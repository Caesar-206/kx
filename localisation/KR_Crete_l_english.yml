### Ideas ###
CRE_med_base:0 "German Mediterranean Base"
CRE_med_base_desc:0 "The island of Crete, especially with its naval base on the south coast, is one of the Kaiser's beloved Mediterranean naval outposts. First earned during the fallout of the Great War as Greece was forced to lease Crete's naval bases to Germany while the island itself was placed under the control of an autonomous civilian government that favors neither Athens or Berlin, Crete is of vital importance to the German Empire's naval maneuvers and operations in the region, especially in regards to safeguarding the Kaiser's beloved new possession in Suez."
CRE_local_tensions:0 "Dual Power"
CRE_local_tensions_desc:0 "The German presence on crete is limited to the small naval base on the southern coast. A civilian government governs the island nominally in the name of the Thunderbolt Regent. In actuality, the civilian government is but a pawn of the garrison, whom use them to keep the locals in check, to ensure the naval base runs without issue. The native Cretans know this, and many are unhappy at this state of affairs. Unless something happened that shook the garrison from its perch, German soft control over crete is here to stay."

CRE_pride_idea:0 ""
CRE_pride_idea:0 "Like in the Greek War of Independence, the people of Crete have risen up against a foreign overlord. Unlike our forebears, we have achieved our independence, succeeding where they failed and driving the occupiers out of our island for good. Despite the Germans not putting up much of a fight, a tremendous feeling of resolve has washed over the Cretan Populace, as our people take pride in knowing we have made our ancestors proud."

CRE_island_under_iron_cross:0 "An Island under the Iron Cross"
CRE_island_under_iron_cross_desc:0 "The German Empire has maintained control of Crete ever since the island was lost to Greece in the Treaty of Salonika. Thus far the situation in the island has been relatively stable, with partisans organizing under the surface and a civilian government managing the affairs of the state. Whether 1936 will prove to be the year that will see it all undone remains to be seen. "
CRE_survey_garrison:0 "Survey the Garrison"
CRE_survey_garrison_desc:0 "The German Garrison which has maintained order in Crete has a somewhat contentious status among the populace of Crete. While they maintain German Rule, the discontent caused by this rowdy band Krauts may mean that they’re more trouble than they’re worth."
CRE_civilian_conflict:0 "Civilian Conflicts"
CRE_civilian_conflict_desc:0 "The Civilian Government maintained under German Rule is largely powerless, however discontent within the island may prove to change this. Yielding more power to this body may smooth over tensions, however is opposed by the bitterly entrenched Admiralty of the Island, who has strongly resisted any attempts at reform. "
CRE_black_monday_strikes:0 "A Time of Troubles"
CRE_black_monday_strikes_desc:0 "Lo and behold, 1936 has brought our dear Kaiserreich nothing but unbridled tragedy. With our coffers empty cuts must be made, and on the top of the docket is the large drain on German finances that is the Cretan Administration. While undoubtedly important for German control of the Mediterranean, the persistence of partisan groups has made the Germans weary of Crete’s value, with some wondering if the kidnapping of Governor Müller is a bleak sign of things to come."

CRE_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Steady as She Goes"
CRE_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "The fears that Crete may be lost to the Kaiserreich have finally been alleviated, as it has become clear without a shadow of a doubt that the German Administration is here to stay. While the Krauts will continue on in Crete, the future shape of the Generalregierung remains to be seen."
CRE_reign_in_crete_govt:0 "Control the Civilian Government"
CRE_reign_in_crete_govt_desc:0 "While the Civilian Government has provided us with an ere of legitimacy, it appears that they have taken their meager jobs to heart.

CRE_force_student_resignations:0 "Curtail Student Organizations"
CRE_force_student_resignations_desc:0 "The Student Organizations have long been a thorn in our side. While we have tolerated them in the past, our patience has finally run out. These troublesome youngsters will have their groups disbanded, or face the consequences. "
CRE_permanant_lease:0 "A Permanent Lease"
CRE_permanant_lease_desc:0 "The German Empire has maintained a lease on the port of Heraklion ever since they gained control of the Island. While there has previously been an understanding that this agreement would be temporary, in practice the German Empire has treated the base as a permanent acquisition. The time has come to end any pretense, the Cretan Generalregierung is here to stay and with it the German Base."
CRE_expand_base:0 "Pacification of Crete"
CRE_expand_base_desc:0 "The German Power base has been concentrated around Heraklion , with the rest of the island being left to its own means. The close call earlier this year has revealed a fatal weakness in this strategy. We can no longer leave traitors to their own devices, they must be dealt with."
CRE_gruss_an_kiel:0 "Grüße in Kiel"
CRE_gruss_an_kiel_desc:0 "Our mission to protect the Mediterranean has not faltered nor failed; rather it has grown stronger than ever. The Kaiserliche Marine can trust that the Mediterranean is safe under the steady watch of the Generalregierung von Kreta. "
CRE_german_iron_fist:0 "The Iron Cross Secured With an Iron Fist"
CRE_german_iron_fist_desc:0 "The close call with annihilation was a direct result of lackluster efforts to pacify Crete. With this fatal weakness revealed, we can return to our true mission of pacifying Crete. No more shall weakness or reform be allowed, as the German Empire moves to secure the Jewel of the Mediterranean with an Iron Fist."
CRE_unity_govt:0 "Form a Unity Government"
CRE_unity_govt_desc:0 "We can not hope to maintain control of Crete if we are reviled by locals. Attempting to root out any source of resistance is a fool’s game; instead, we must work with the Civilian Government and reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. While angering harliners, this strategy will buy us some goodwill with the people of Crete, and hopefully help us maintain German Rule."

CRE_end_of_germs:0 "The Evacuation"

CRE_student_revolt_suceeds:0 "Partisans Take Control"
CRE_student_revolt_suceeds_desc:0 "With the Germans Gone, the myriad of Partisan and Student Groups has seized control of the now-vacant Government. While Crete may be free, the new caretaker government is composed of groups that can agree on little but hating the German Empire. If we are to survive as a nation, a consensus on how Crete is to be governed must be reached."
CRE_theriso_legacy:0 "The Drosoulites at Peace"
CRE_theriso_legacy_desc:0 "Local legend tells of a long procession of visions, an army of restless ghosts dedicated to Cretan Freedom. These shadows, dressed in black and armed with weapons, move from the monastery of Agios Charalambos and advance towards the old fort, Frangokastello. Led by Hatzimichalis Dalianis, these ghosts have been rather consistent for both our German and Turkish Occupiers. This year, these shadows have not appeared, signaling that our island is truly free from foreign overlords. "
CRE_question_of_greece:0 "The Question of Re-Unification"

CRE_monarchy:0 "A Monarchy for Crete"
CRE_monarchy_desc:0 "The Monarchist Alexandros Zaimis has gained control of Crete’s Government. Distrustful of the ability for the Government of Greece proper to gauge the opinions of the Greek people on the Kingdom, he has elected to maintain Crete’s independence, and maintain his own brand of Conservative Monarchism in his homeland of Crete."
CRE_crete_monarchy:0 "An Independent Kingdom"
CRE_crete_monarchy_desc:0 "The Greeks have made their thoughts on Monarchism clear, and while we respect their choice, we no longer wish to be involved in the Greek Project. While Monarchism is a spent force in Greece proper, we can still return the Rightful King to his throne in Crete. Forget Athens! The true bastion of Greek Monarchism is here in Crete."
CRE_greek_monarchy_in_exile:0 "The King in Exile"
CRE_greek_monarchy_in_exile_desc:0 "It is clear to anyone with eyes that the Greek Monarchy referendum was a rigged exercise in control for an illegitimate Republican Government. Thankfully, we have been saved from overlordship by this Government, and are free to recognize the legitimate results of the Referendum. The Greek King shall find safe haven in Crete, as we embark to dislodge the false government of [GRE.GetLeader] and move to restore the Greek Monarchy. "
CRE_free_state_redeemed:0 "The Free State Redeemed"
CRE_free_state_redeemed_desc:0 "While we are greatly appreciative of our brothers in mainland Greece, we would prefer the option of maintaining our independence. While disappointing to the Greek Government, we know that Greece and Crete remaining as separate states is for the best. "

CRE_independence:0 "True Independence"
CRE_independence_desc:0 "We shall not yield to those who wish to see Crete subjected. Instead, we shall focus on maintaining our independent island paradise, hoping that cordial relations with the great powers will save us from the horror of armed conflict."

CRE_vileyat:0 "The Vilayet of Crete"
CRE_vileyat_desc:0 "Once more the Island of Crete finds itself under Turkish Rule. While the Sultan has promised a gentle hand in handling Cretan affairs, citizens aren’t holding their breath. While undoubtedly glad to see the German Garrison depart, it seems as if they have just been replaced with another hostile occupying force. "
CRE_turkish_immigration:0 "Encourage Turkish Settlement"

CRE_inspect_garrison:0 "Inspect the Garrison"
CRE_inspect_garrison_desc:0 "The German Garrison has a reputation as a drunken band of incompetent hooligans more interested in bedding local women than actually doing their jobs. The fatal weakness of the Garrison was revealed in the kidnapping attempt on Governor Müller, as our inexperienced garrison failed to fight off a band of disorganized partisans and schoolchildren. We must reorganize our fighting force in Crete to account for any threats to German Rule that may present themselves."
CRE_ostasien_experience:0 "Colonial Experience"
CRE_ostasien_experience_desc:0 "The mighty German Empire holds countless holdings across the globe who have armies experiences in guarding territories to who’s populace are actively hostile.

CRE_guard_med:0 "Guardians of Mediterranean Holdings"
CRE_guard_med_desc:0 "Strategically placed, Crete has become the lynchpin of the Mediterranean in the German Empire. With Crete under our control, the Kaiserreich holds the ability to project its power throughout the vast Mediterranean Sea, an ability which few of history’s Empires can claim. "
CRE_greek_army:0 "An Independent Army"

CRE_defense_of_crete:0 "Defense of Crete"
CRE_defense_of_crete_desc:0 "Crete, while naturally easy to defend due to its mountainous terrain, still remains mostly defenseless in the case of full-scale invasion. To remedy this glaring hole in our defense, we will begin constructing a wall of forts and bunkers along our coastline. This new patchwork of defensive infrastructure will dot the Cretan coast and ensure a struggle for any army that dares land on our shores."

CRE_economy:0 "The Cretan Economy"

CRE_fruit_plantations_desc:0 "In addition to Olive, oranges, citrons and avocadoes are also cultivated on our island. Fruit, remaining a profitable industry through thick and thin, is a smart investment for our agricultural board.

We shall promote the Banana Industry and become one of Europe's main providers of the fruit."
CRE_tourism:0 "Encourage Tourism"

### Events ###

crete.1.t:0 "Georg Alexander von Müller Disappears"
crete.1.d:0 "Partisans, long dissatisfied with German Rule over the Island of Crete have finally made their move today, kidnapping longtime Governor of the Island Georg Alexander von Müller. Müller's car was ambushed while en route from his residence to his divisional headquarters. Müller was tied and forced into the back seat while two partisans impersonated him and his driver respectively. Müller's notorious impatience at roadblocks enabled the car to pass numerous checkpoints before being abandoned at the hamlet of Heliana. As of now the fate of Crete seems to be up in the air, as questions abound in the absence of our Governor."
crete.1.a:0 "Dreadful!"

crete.2.t:0 "Finding Müller"
crete.2.d:0 "Thousands of German Soldiers have been mobilized to hunt down the rats who have kidnapped our Governor. Müller's captors have made an unsuccessful attempt to flee to Egypt, yet have been stopped by a German Blockade. It has become clear in this time that any attempts made to escape the island would be in foolish, and they are left with two choices: surrender and hope for leniency, or execute Governor Müller and permanently end his tyranny over the island."
crete.2.a:0 "We Found him Just in Time!"
crete.2.b:0 "We were too late, the Governor is dead..."

crete.3.t:0 "A New Governor"
crete.3.d:0 "With Müller dying in a failed kidnapping attempt, a new Governor is needed for our island. The choices are the more harsh Alexander Andrae, the more moderate Theo Osterkamp, or the paratrooper Walter Koch. "

crete.3.b:0 "Walter Koch."
crete.3.c:0 "Theo Osterkamp."

crete.4.t:0 "Restructuring"
crete.4.d:0 "With Black Monday striking the German Sphere, cutbacks must be made. The first place that came to mind for the bean-counters in Berlin was the German-Held island of Crete. Crete, while holding importance as the German Lynchpin in the Mediterranean, is a rebel-infested drain on the German Empire's finances. Cutting our losses and abandoning the Island to its fate would save us dearly needed funds. We could also attempt to sell the Island to one of its neighbors, who have long squabbles over the territory."
crete.4.a:0 "We have nothing, Sell the Damn Island..."
crete.4.b:0 "German Rule over Crete is Doomed, Prepare to Flee!"
crete.4.c:0 "We will hold on to Crete by any means!"

crete.5.t:0 "The Fate of Crete"
crete.5.d:0 "With the German Garrison evacuating Crete, a temporary civilian government has been formed to decide the future of Crete. The question on everyone's mind is what form the new State of Crete will take. Will we rejoin Greece? The Ottoman Empire? Shall we look to the Exiles for protection? All must be answered soon."
crete.5.a:0 "George Tzikas founds a Liberal-Conservative Democracy!"
crete.5.b:0 "Alexandros Zaimis establishes a Pro-Greek Regency Council!"
crete.5.c:0 "Patrick Leigh Fermor and his Entente Spies seize control!"

crete.6.t:0 "Chaos in the Fallschirmjäger Ranks"
crete.6.d:0 "The appointment of Walter Koch as Governor of Crete has allowed the prestigious Fallschirmjäger, or Paratroopers, to gain sway within the Military Governance of Crete. While typically ignored in the sphere of operations in the wider Empire, Crete has become a center of Paratrooper training and operations, with much of the German Brass experienced in the area moving to Crete. This has led to a new band of radicals who flavor new and radical forms of warfare gunning for Crete's top job."
crete.6.a:0 "Richard Heidrich Seizes Control and Establishes a Government Loyal to von Göring!"
crete.6.b:0 "Kurt Student Restores Order and stays with Berlin."

crete.7.t:0 "Rejoin the Homeland?"
crete.7.d:0 "With the German Empire being expelled from Crete's shores, the question of re-union with Greece has emerged. While many are in favour of this, others are more skeptical of rejoining the Athens Government."
crete.7.a:0 "The Time has Come to Reunify!"
crete.7.b:0 "On Second Thought, let us Retain Independence!"

crete.8.t:0 "Crete Returns Home"
crete.8.d:0 "While this year has brought us catastrophe after catastrophe, it seems one piece of good news has trickled to [GRE.GetLeader]'s desk. The Island of Crete, formerly a German possession, has thrown off its chains and is now looking to rejoin Greece. Our humiliating loss of Crete has now been undone, as the Nation of Greece is one step closer to being whole."
crete.8.a:0 "Excellent News!"

crete.9.t:0 "Revolution in Crete"
crete.9.d:0 "It was hoped after the German Evacuation of Crete that the Island would return to Greek Rule, however that has turned out not to be the case as [CRE.GetLeader] has formally refused the prospect of rejoining Greece. This refusal has infuriated [GRE.GetLeader], who is mulling the possibility of using force to take back the now unprotected island."
crete.9.a:0 "Unacceptable, Launch an Invasion at Once!"
crete.9.b:0 "Such a thing would be Useless Bloodsh

crete.10.t:0 "Crete Rejoins Greece"
crete.10.d:0 "The outcome of the German abandonment of Crete was the Pro-Entente Partisans led by Patrick Leigh Fermor seizing control of the Island. Now with Greece also joining the Entente, negotiations for bringing Crete back in to the Greek Nation have succeeded. Now, Greece is one step closer to being whole. "
crete.10.a:0 "Wonderful!"

crete_sale.1.t:0 "The Cretan Question"
crete_sale.1.d:0 "With our economy in shambles after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. The main territory that has been under examination is Crete.
