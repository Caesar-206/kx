### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
POLITICS_FELIX_GOUIN_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Born as Alfred-Georges Gressent, to a working-class peasant family in 1878, Georges was invested in politics from an early age. Becoming an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel whilst working as his secretary, however he was not always a man of the left. After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny. He has also advocated for vengeance against Germany and the reclamation of lost French territory."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat was born in 1894 to a modest family, in his youth he excelled at his studies and became involved in left-wing politics. A student of Radical politician Émile Chartier he joined the SFIO,  however this political stint came to end when the Weltkrieg broke out. A staunch patriot he enlisted in the French Army and saw active duty, earning the Legion of Honour and five bravery citations. The Weltkrieg shaped his political views, forging a deep hatred for Germany and the French elite who he saw as failing the nation. During the lead up the French Civil War, Déat has positioned himself to the right of the socialist movement, advocating for an authoritarian anti-capitalist state. His work was published by Valois who had taken interest in Déat and the two became fast allies, when the General Strike led to civil conflict Déat declared loyalty to the Sorelans.\n\nRepresenting the ‘Vanguardist’ faction of the Sorelians, Déat has proved himself to be an opportunist first, and ideologue second. Forging connections with former political enemies and taking action against fellow comrades, Déat has fought his way to the top of the Sorelian leadership. Now in control of the National Worker’s State, Chairman Déat can lead the authoritarian anti-capitalist regime he always envisioned."
POLITICS_MARCEL_BUCARD_DESC:0 "Many things Marcel Bucard has been called over the years. Syndicalist, Anti-semite, Nationalist, Worker. Beginning life as the son of a butcher in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Marcel Bucard initially studied to become a Catholic Priest. This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Ultranationalist-Syndicalists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the National Worker’s State, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective. To him, the superior French proletariat have smashed the chains of their masters and can no longer be defeated by any force!"
POLITICS_MAURICE_THOREZ_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was born in Pas-de-Calais, France on the 28th of April, 1900. Becoming a coal miner at the young age of 12. He would go on to join the French Section of the Workers’ International at the age of 19. His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, causing him to become enamored with the ideas of Communism and a very enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The ultimate failure of the Bolsheviks led Thorez to conclude that they had not been pure or strong enough, that they had failed both Lenin, Marx, and Robespierre by their inability to take every measure necessary for the revolution. Thorez would take up arms in the Second French Revolution, declaring himself as a syndicalist to disguise his true communist nature. A charismatic leader, many flocked to him for his bold speeches and devotion to the Revolution. Once the Commune of France had been established, however, he revealed his true colors, declaring the Commune a bourgeois fourth republic, and converting his followers to the ways of communism. Now calling themselves the “Jacobins” after the radicals of Robespierre, Thorez and his followers became an immense thorn in the side of the CGT. Considering himself to be the successor to Robespierre and Lenin, Thorez would be dismissed as a political failure for his inability to win a seat in the CGT. But now with his rule secured by his astounding victory in the 1936 elections, the “political failure” is determined to live up to his predecessors and crush all who stand in his way of creating a true Communist French utopia."
POLITICS_FRENCH_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With Chairman Valois now dead, power has been vested within the Sorelian Council. Valois never named his successor in the event of his death, therefore to avoid further conflict the Comité de Salut Public was formed. Chaired by Peirre Laval, the council lacks unity with it being split between two competing factions. Valois’s secretary, Marcel Déat leads the Vanguardists whilst commander of the Revolutionary Legion, Marcel Bucard, leads the Ultranational-Syndicalists. With the threat of anarchy looming, can the council unify behind a single leader or will it collapse..."
POLITICS_BLACK_GUARD_DESC:0 "Officially the ‘Free Territory of France’ has no leader, upon liberating towns Makhno’s men have announced their intention to leave all governing to the workers themselves. Laws and authority is enforced by fully autonomous communes which are usually commanded by a worker’s council. However despite this supposed unlimited freedom and abolition of all hierarchies, the most powerful man in the nation is undoubtedly Nestor Makhno. His role as the protector of anarchy allows him command large numbers of Black Guard soldiers who station themselves across the Free Territory. When his men require rest and food the citizens of communes oblige, Makhno chooses to not involve himself in the politics of anarchist communes however it would be unwise to challenge any decision he could make..."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "Born into a military family, 20 September 1872, Maurice Gustave Gamelin was always destined for military greatness. Entering into the Saint-Cyr Military Academy he graduated first in his class, going on to serve in Tunisia. Serving as attaché to future Marshal of France, General Joseph Joffre, this position provided Gamelin with a solid knowledge of strategic and tactical warfare. During the Weltkrieg he distinguished himself for helping plan the victory at the Battle of the Marne. Quickly being promoted all the way to Brigadier General however with the German offensive of 1918 pushing further and further into France, Gamelin was recalled to Paris. Leading a desperate defence of the capital he held the lines just long enough for a civilian extraction saving countless lives. After the war he maintained a high ranking position in the military, as civil tension escalated he refused to allow politics to sway his loyalty to France. When the syndicalist revolutionaries were successful, Gamelin offered his services to the government and was made Marshal of the Commune of France. This came to an end when the Jacobin regime was declared.\n\nAs the Jacobin rule of tyranny tore France apart, Gamelin realised that his backseat in politics must end. Forging an alliance Léon Blum, a Popular Front backed by the military, has overthrown Thorez’s dictatorship with Gamelin proclaimed as Maréchal. Many now regard Gamelin as the defender of Communard democracy, and saviour of France."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Born into a poor peasantry family in Ukraine, 26 October 1888, Nestor Ivanovych Makhno was forced to adapt quickly to a harsh life. Extreme poverty led to him finding work for himself, being employed at a local iron foundry he witnessed the rise of revolutionary anti-Tsarist politics. Having experienced the Tsarist Regime’s brutality himself he joined local anarchists and took part in robberies resulting in his imprisonment. When the Weltkrieg broke out he remained a prisoner, sentenced to death by hanging, this came to end with the Russian Revolution. Being freed he left for Ukraine, forming connections with anarchists he established the ‘Black Army’ to fight against both Ukrainian nationalists and the intervening German forces. When Germany secured its dominance of the nation he fled his homeland for France.\n\n Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his popularity and notability in French politics. Forming the ‘Black Guard’ terrorist organization which has now overthrown the Sorelian regime. With the failures of Ukraine and France, Makhno has been further radicalised by the Illegalists. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future. However his efforts to destroy any remnants of authority in the commune with the establishment of the ‘Free Territory of France’ have so far been successful. These successes may be in vain however, for his personal army of anarchists are the only thing that can prevent France’s neighbours from taking advantage of this chaos..."
POLITICS_LOUIS_NIEL_DESC: "Originally a simple, modest café boy, Louis Niel's life story continues to inspire young Syndicalists today. Born in Corsica in 1872 into a modest family from Bastia, Louis was self-taught, taught to read and write on his own, and quickly forged a political conscience by observing the deplorable living conditions of workers in his native Corsica, which he traveled throughout his teenage years.\n\nHe soon left for the mainland, however, to join the local branch of the CGT in Montpellier, where he was noted for his diligence, exemplary intellectual qualities, calm, thoughtful temperament and undeniable administrative, organizational and stewardship skills. Universally liked and respected by all the Socialist, Communist and Revolutionary currents of the left, Louis Niel wrote articles for a variety of newspapers, from the Anarchist 'Les Temps Nouveaux' to the Communist 'l'Humanité'. These qualities enabled him to climb the ranks of the CGT step by step, until he found himself in the position of General Secretary and thus leader of the CGT in 1909. Despite his skills, Louis Niel found himself elected in a climate of Syndicalist tension, notably between the Reformist and Revolutionary currents. Niel tried to reconcile the two as best he could, but found himself up against the charismatic Léon Jouhaux. These conditions led to his resignation, famously declaring 'I never thought I'd fall into an environment so decomposed by political passions or personal quarrels'. He returned to his life as an administrator and organizer in the shadows, and played a key role in coordinating the unions during the Revolution against the Third Republic.\n\nNiel did, however, return to the limelight recently: after the CGT had seen its majority dwindle and feared losing it, it decided to elect Louis Niel, a unifying figure, as President of the Congress of Trade Unions, a role he accepted without complaint, but without enthusiasm either, content to follow the CGT line. The political climate is not the most unstable at the start of 1936, but some people fear that if a major crisis shakes the country, Louis would not be the ideal man to respond..."

## Starting Ideas ##
FRA_home_of_the_international_revolution: "Home of the International Revolution"
FRA_home_of_the_international_revolution_desc: "The Federation of the Communes of France is the first country in the world where a revolution of a Socialist nature has been successful and a workers' state has been established. This fact lends great prestige to our country and makes it the center of the world proletarian revolutionary movement, with numerous organizations representing workers from all over the world to be found, for example the leadership of the Left Kuomintang, many pan-African intellectuals, thinkers of the Negritude movement, militants of the ENA and many others.\n\nFor all the world's proletarians, France is a light in the darkness of an imperialist world, and all the world's Socialist militants share the dream of one day being delegates to one of the great congresses of the Third International in Paris."
FRA_rural_religious_question: "The Rural and Religious Question"
FRA_rural_religious_question_desc: "Where the Revolution was largely welcomed by the urban proletariat, the reaction of the rural population was quite different. Indeed, despite some support, such as from Marceau Pivert's PSOP activists, rural reaction to the advent of Socialism in France ranged from indifference to opposition. Rural populations, mostly made of farmers, are traditionally very religious, and therefore greatly influenced by the hostile Church, and see Syndicalism as an ideology favoring the cities at the expense of the countryside. The appropriate approach to have regarding these problems is very different, depending on which Communard politicians or intellectuals you ask, but whatever the case, this question must be settled as soon as possible if we are to ensure continued stability for France."
FRA_divided_defenders: "The Divided Defenders of the Revolution"
FRA_divided_defenders_desc: "The defense and expression of the military interests of the Commune is ensured by our army, the ARF (Armée Révolutionnaire Française, or French Revolutionary Army in English) under the direction of Marshal Maurice Gamelin. However, in parallel with the ARF, there are many revolutionary militias of opposing tendencies, acting outside any command of the Army. This has led to many tensions between the ARF and the militias, the ARF seeing in the militias disorganized bands of bandits enforcing their laws wherever they are and perpetuating violence in the name of the organizations to which they are attached, demanding the bringing to heel or the dissolution of these militias for the good of the Revolution and stability. The militias see in the Army the expression of a reactionary and outdated structure that they would do well to reform or even abolish. These tensions should be resolved as quickly as possible, by one means or another, before they result in uncontrollable violence."
FRA_les_grand_travaux: "Les Grand Travaux"
FRA_les_grand_travaux_desc: "The term 'Grand Travaux' refers to the economic policy pursued by the People's Delegate for Economic Affairs Julien Racamond, a member of the CGT originating from the rural proletariat. The purpose of this economic plan was to continue the industrialization of France by promoting local economic planning carried out by the various municipalities and the unions and making the transition from the Capitalist economy of the Third Republic to a Syndicalist economy. Its results were moderate and failed to define a clear direction for the economic orientation that the new workers' state should take, with the economic system being neither Anarchist, nor Centralist, nor relying on an assertive social market, this confused situation leads inexorably to a noticeable loss of popularity for the CGT with critics demanding an overhaul of the project or a new economic project becoming more and more common."
FRA_tempered_revanchism: "Tempered Revanchism"
FRA_tempered_revanchism_desc: "The Revolution began in 1919 with demands for peace and an end to conflict tearing France apart, since then it evolved into a revolution ending all of the old order in France. The Pacifist feelings, predominant in the majority of the Left movements, imbued the new French society with its values. But the Kaiser's new world order only saw increasing world tensions with aggressive Imperialism and shameless Colonialism, which led many to see armed struggle as the only way to put an end to these filthy ideals and at the same time restore French military prestige and liberate our oppressed brothers and sisters in Alsace-Lorraine. Our society is therefore divided between those retaining the original Pacifist positions of 1919, in the tradition of the venerable Jean Jaurés who died for them, and those wishing a re-militarization in order to be prepared for a future world conflict, whether for ideological reasons or French pride."

metallurgique_de_normandie: "Société Métallurgique de Normandie"
metallurgique_de_normandie_desc: "§gExploited since Gallo-Roman times, iron mines in the upper Orne valley allowed modest metallurgical activity. At the beginning of the 20th century, the exploitation of the Soumont iron ore deposit in Potigny revitalized metallurgical activity in Calvados. In 1901, when they were established, the mines belonged to a German industrialist August Thyssen. It was not until 1917 when minister Albert Thomas, from the SFIO, symbolically lit the first blast furnace, the largest in the world at the time. The company received name of Société Normande de Métallurgie. The nationalization has brought the mine into the state ownership and since then, steel production has only increased.§!"

The Weltkrieg caused a halt to international civil engineer contracts, as most of the company's sales were overseas. The company started to develop its industry, especially in the field of armament and military infrastucture.

Marius Berliet started his experiments with automobiles in 1894, producing both cars and buses, until the Weltkrieg - when the French Army’s need for military vehicles made him the richest automobile manufacturer in France. By 1917 the value of annual turnover had multiplied fourfold since the start of the war - but as the Revolution was over, Maurice Berliet lost control of his plant due to the nationalization. Almost 4 thousand workers now were in control of the Berliet, but the outbreak of peace halved the overall output.

de_dion_bouton_desc: "§gDe Dion, Bouton et Trépardoux was formed in 1883 by the Marquis Jules-Albert de Dion, Georges Bouton and Charles Trépardoux, after de Dion saw a toy locomotive in a store window. Inspired by steam (in the form of rail locomotives) and with ample money, three men agreed to start an automobile company - the world's largest automobile manufacturer for a time, becoming well known for their quality, reliability and durability. During the Weltkrieg, the company produced armoured vehicles and aircraft engines, as well as cars and trucks, also producing an anti-aircraft version of the Canon de 75 modèle 1897, mounted on a V8-powered De Dion-Bouton truck for the French Army between 1913 and 1918.

During the Weltkrieg, the company built several different types of weapons, notably the Saint Chamond-Mondragón 75 mm gun which had been designed mostly by colonel Rimailho, the Saint-Chamond tank and the deficient Chauchat machine rifle. They also produced naval guns, such as the quadruple gun turret design for the unfinished Normandie-class battleships.

His bourgeois plans were, however, doomed. While Louis Renault escaped with the reactionaries to Algeria, his plants stayed, now in the hands of the Commune government. The workers and syndicates, that represented them, decided that the new tank manufacturer for the Commune will not have the name of a traitor and enemy of proletariat. Instead, the company and its plants were nationalized under the name \"Régie des usines Renault (RUR - Management of the Renault Factories)\", marking the new milestone in the history of French tank production.

FRA_empower_comite_de_salut_public_desc:0 "The Committee of Public Safety defended France in its first revolution against reactionary forces, and now it shall do so again. But whereas before it defended the bourgeois revolution against feudalism, it shall now be even more progressive in defending the workers revolution against the capitalist class. Their powers shall be enhanced and their committee leaders must clearly favor one Jacobin faction over another for internal stability."
FRA_orthodox_jacobin:0 "Orthodox Jacobin Line"
FRA_orthodox_jacobin_desc:0 "The Orthodox Jacobins under Thorez have won the internal debates, but while they occupy much of party leadership their power must be cemented against the pseudo-communists under Doriot.

FRA_party_bureaucracy:0 "Red Politiboro"
FRA_party_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The Bolshevik Political Bureau originally intended to protect the Russian Revolution from the Whites but failed due to a lack of proper organization. Nonetheless, the idea itself is solid and allowed for them to put a fight where there would have been none. But this time it shall have the organization needed to carry out its will, with prominent Jacobins rewarded for their loyalty with bureaucratic positions and an expanded Committee of General Security, both of which can implement administrative commands from our leadership."
FRA_purity_of_marx:0 "The Purity of Marx"
FRA_purity_of_marx_desc:0 "The revolutions in the West vindicated Marxist theory analyzing the inherent weaknesses of capitalism and bourgeois pseudo-democracy, not infantile syndicalist theories that focus on thoughtless action. We must go further in advancing Marxist sciences, assigning the the Finance Committee with calculating the average productivity of socially useful labor with which to reward workers alongside the management of newly nationalized major industries formerly incoherent handled by uncoordinated CGT unions."
FRA_end_factionalism:0 "Total Left-Unity"
FRA_end_factionalism_desc:0 "The left has been marked by sectarian infighting for too long, being partly responsible for the fall of the Bolsheviks in the first place. The Commune shall not fall victim to the same mistake in the face of reactionary aggression. The surviving left opposition must accept Communist Party dominance and Marxist principles at once, being allowed to debate within the party so long as they swear to ultimately obey the Party's direction while renouncing their anti-scientific, week or false variants of socialism, while the smaller unions within the CGT will be nationalized."

FRA_the_socialist_new_man_desc:0 "We are verging on a world without oppression and alienation, one headed by a New Man made up of the ranks currently considered 'proletariat' in our current system. This New Man will be egalitarian, altrustic, class-conscience and defensive of socialist values. We shall uphold this ideal in our literature, art and speaking campaigns as neccessary to achieve a Marxist utopia and to drum up support for the current regime."
FRA_union_party_unity:0 "Union-Party Merger"
FRA_union_party_unity_desc:0 "The CGT has gotten us far in achieving socialism but the Communist Party represents the vanguard of all worker and the advancement of international socialism, and as such must come first.

FRA_communist_youth:0 "Jeunesse Communiste Empowerment"
FRA_communist_youth_desc:0 "It is not the crusty bureaucrats and party elders who make up the energetic core of the Party, but instead the Communist Youth who are more fanatical and loyal.

Those who refuse state employment and to turn a profit for our new endeavors will be penalized."

Within the French People is a desire, and history, of fighting for both egalitarianism and fraternity, something our military recruitment must emphasize both to gain soldiers and to appeal to the French people as well as nationalists while undermining National France's claims of being the true representatives of the French People. Likewise, it must be made clear that France is the Vanguard of the Revolution, and its imitators, while allies, must understand that they stand behind us, not vice-versa."
FRA_blanquist_leadership:0 "Blanquist Leadership"
FRA_blanquist_leadership_desc:0 "The foolish Thorez-Wing of the Party would have had us openly debate strategy and policy among the Party Leadership, constantly writing theory for the PCF. However, a true Vanguard must operate in secret, with Doriot and his top allies entrusted with exclusive executive power and military tactics to be discussed behind backdoors so that our hand is never tipped, while our own internal surveillance will be expanded so that they may have the best information available."
FRA_peasant_worker_republic:0 "Peasant-Worker Collaboratism"
FRA_peasant_worker_republic_desc:0 "The more orthodox Marxists within the party would have focused nearly exclusively on the workers and shifting the peasants towards proletarianization, but the National Jacobins understand the impracticality of this. A Syndicate of Farm Production will make greater attempts at outreach to farmers via capital investments and further cultural appeals while producing propaganda showing their value in our society, while rural schools teaching National Jacobin will be expanded."

FRA_national_emancipation_desc:0 "We must learn from the mistakes of the first French Revolution that was damaged by Girondin traitors and their Austrian allies.

FRA_redemption_through_labor_desc:0 "Within the Commune remain those traitors who sided with or expressed sympathy for National France.

FRA_single_party:0 "A Single Party"
FRA_single_party_desc:0 "Several parties still desire to contend the CGT elections alongside informal organizations of often Sorelian or anarchist nature. However for those that still exist, they must understand their redunency when the PCF already exists, for factionalism would destroy us and the Party must register all of the people to represent their will. As such, all competing political organizations will be banned or made a subset of the PCF, and all citizens of France will be registered with the PCF at once."
FRA_agriculture_statism:0 "State Agriculture"
FRA_agriculture_statism_desc:0 "The baffling nature of the syndicalist congress did not lead to a dictatorship of the proletariat so much as it created the rule of chaos, with the peasant regions having a mixed reception with the revolution and remaining badly coordinated with urban regions. With all peasants now registered with the PCF, they must be aided by the nationalization of farms so that their production can be coordinated with the rest of the Commune."
FRA_communal_front:0 "Sword of the Revolution"
FRA_communal_front_desc:0 "We have done much to push French industry, and militarization, even further than it once was. But we must live up accomplish what the Jacobins and Trotsky in being the Vanguard of the world, which will require a military capable of smashing reactionaries. Further military factories and recruitment must be expanded while the masses are prepared for their part in the libertion of mankind."
FRA_total_partisanship:0 "Absolute Partisanship"
FRA_total_partisanship_desc:0 "Let it be known that to be apolitical is, in fact, to side against the proletariat. Jacobin outlets and propaganda must be expanded while displays of bourgeois values in other media must be crushed and absolute party discipline must be expected from Party members as the number of political officers are expanded and all Party members in Congress, newly christened or not, expected to swear allegiance to the Vanguard's values and drop heterodox thought."
FRA_communist_enlightenment:0 "Communist Enlightenment"
FRA_communist_enlightenment_desc:0 "There is a second age of Enlightenment upon us, one that we must carry one as vigoriously as the Jacobins of 1793 did.

FRA_centralized_banking:0 "Currency Stabilization"
FRA_centralized_banking_desc:0 "Since the Commune has been estabished, weak motions have been made in favor of replacing the former french currency with union-backed labor vouchers. However this goes practically ignored by much of the Commune except for the most hardline syndicalists, with a combination of barter, various labor-notes and money being used to exchange goods. We need to facilitate the transition to a single government-backed currency for most of the Commune, even if the unions choose to continue to print their own vouchers separately to trade amongst each other a single paper currency should be the only universal one as to stabilize the economy."
FRA_militia_controls:0 "Congressional Militias"
FRA_militia_controls_desc:0 "The various red militias are well-intentioned and even useful at times, but each have their own internal codes of conduct depending on which faction they answer to and their loyalty to the Army is questionable.

FRA_universal_administration:0 "Universal Administration"
FRA_universal_administration_desc:0 "A universal administration must be streamlined and expanded to make Congressional coordination with the unions simpler and allow for a way for all citizens to connect with the government without going through the unions.

FRA_workers_and_peasants_party_desc:0 "While much progress was made, Pivert was aware the so-called reformists would eventually go too far in attempting to reign in the revolution and the gadfly of the French Revolutionaries has successfully managed to wrestle control of Congress! Now his party shall estabish a Commune that is equal parts revolutionary and stable."
FRA_communal_negotiations:0 "Communal Negotiations"
FRA_communal_negotiations_desc:0 "While the other factions of the Cartel were clearly tired of the anarchist communes, the PSOP is more understanding of their complaints.

FRA_municipal_syndicates:0 "Municipal Syndicates"
FRA_municipal_syndicates_desc:0 "The Syndicates were a step forward in the right direction, but remain unbalanced due to their current organization.

FRA_revolutionary_party:0 "Revolutionary Party"

FRA_internal_democracy:0 "Internal Democracy"
FRA_internal_democracy_desc:0 "The PSOP must run off of greater internal democracy or else it will give into the Vanguard mindset, even the absurd democratic centralist one.

FRA_popular_committees:0 "Popular Committees"
FRA_popular_committees_desc:0 "Within urban regions, local industries interests are often subsued by loyalty to the national union, but with the PSOP's Popular Committees we will focus on electing local representatives who will coordinate more intensely with the unions while enacting popular localist legislation voted for by all local PSOP members."

FRA_modern_communication_techniques_desc:0 "It has never been easier to speak to the masses, but too many refuse to modernize our communication infrastructure to allow it.

FRA_chemins_de_fer_desc:0 "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became.

FRA_work_design_coop_desc:0 "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques.

This will stop, we will avenge them all. The first Weltkrieg was not the last."
FRA_renseignements_generaux:0 "The Renseignements Généraux"

The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"

### Events ###

comfrance.1.t: "The Situation of the Commune – the Revolution"
comfrance.1.d: "The history of France is that of the Revolution, from that of 1798 to that of 1919, not forgetting that of 1848. In 1914, mankind's deadliest war began, and during the spring of 1919, it seemed clear that victory was impossible. That's why Léon Jouhaux's CGT called for a general strike to put an end to the bloodshed and suffering of the workers, as impotent governments collapsed one by one and chaos took hold of the country. More and more voices called for an end to the fighting, including that of General Gamélin, who was accused of crypto-Socialism and intelligence with the enemy, and threatened with national disqualification and imprisonment.\n\nThis led the General and some of the troops under his command to join the CGT, whose intentions had by then become completely revolutionary, with Socialist militias of all types organizing throughout the country. These conditions led to a violent civil war between the Syndicalist forces and the government, which was overtaken by events. Finally, in June 1920, the proletariat was victorious over the moribund Republic, which took refuge in Algiers, and a peace treaty was signed with the German Empire. The Federation des Communes de France was proclaimed on July 14, 1920, following the drafting of a temporary constitution."
comfrance.1.a: "What form did the new Socialist state had?"

comfrance.2.t: "The Situation of the Commune – Political System"
comfrance.2.d: "The governmental structure of the Commune of France was established by the Popular Constitution of 1920 and differs from that of the Third Republic. The Syndicalist system is indeed highly decentralized with most of the power being grouped in the local government of each commune, the elected members of these councils are members of unions and are elected by the inhabitants of the Commune, a chairman of the council, assisted of an elected executive, is also elected and belongs in the majority of cases to the union which possess a majority of delegates on the council.\n\nA similar system exists on a national level, the assembly bringing together union representatives from all over the country is called the Bourse Générale du Travail and has a Chairman, currently Louis Niel in 1936, who is assisted by the equivalent a government in the form of the Comité de Salut Public with delegates to different functions such as the economy or external affairs, although the effective decision-making power resides mainly in the Bourse Générale du Travail. The communard economic system is also largely decentralized based mainly on cooperatives and on the principles of worker self-management, although economic policies of national scope exist such as the one launched by Julien Racamond in 1923. Political parties do exist in the Commune but exercise their power only through trade unions they control or to which they are close."
comfrance.2.a: "What about the recent history of the Commune?"

comfrance.3.t: "The Situation of the Commune – Recent History"
comfrance.3.d: "After the Revolution, elections were organized and the CGT being the only unions with real weight to win won logically. Léon Jouhaux became the first chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail dominated by the CGT, however the unified revolutionary dream began to show its limits, the economic plan named 'les Grand Travaux' launched by Julien Racamond indeed created a socialist economy but juggling between statism, anarchism and social market, it failed to reach a consensus among any of the factions.\n\nLéon Jouhaux did not manage to satisfy the various factions emerging within the CGT, the Anarchists such as Sébastien Faure, Emile Pouget and Pierre Monatte reproached him for his too statist and centralist approach while the Marxists like Maurice Thorez, Marcel Cachin or Jacques Duclos supporting until then the CGT but feeling marginalised, left to form the rival CGT-FO, a purely communist union, bringing together, in addition to the Jacobins, the more moderate PSOP. The moderates, notably the SFIO and the PRS, criticized the perceived radicalism of the CGT and founded their own union, the CFDT with the support of communard citizens nostalgic of the Third Republic and the calmer times associated with it, as well as other minority groups such as the Neo-Socialists of Marcél Déat. Some other minority factions emerged such as the intellectual group of the Sorelians, with few elected officials and not having their own unions, their influence within the CGT is however growing and it would be a mistake to underestimate them.\n\nAlthough the Revolution was quite popular with the urban proletariat, it was quite different for the countryside, indeed the conservative and discontent peasants regrouped around the Christian trade union CFTC while the most radical of them joined the mysterious resistance movement MLSF.\n\nThis instability led to the comfortable majority of the CGT being greatly endangered in the 1934 elections, which led to the ousting of the controversial Jouhaux and the appointment of Louis Niel, a man making more of a consensus among the unions, the political situation in 1936 remains calm but a single drop of water could cause the CGT to lose its majority and drag the Commune into an uncertain future…"

comfrance.5.d:0 "Despite the successful organisation of the Syndicalist Congress in May, the Pivert administration has been criticised for its lack of response to the crackdown on trade unions in Germany. Today, the opposition in the Bourse Générale du Travail has agreed to a vote of no confidence in Pivert, who has announced that new elections will be brought forward to elect a new Comité.

comfrance.6.d:0 "Due to the presence of trade unions within the Communard Army, it has become overly politicised, creating tensions within the Guarantor of National Integrity and the Arm of the Syndicalist Revolution! This has resulted in the incumbent Chief of Staff, the popular civil war general Maurice Gamelin, having to step down.

The Travailleurs are now looking towards the Russian émigré Boris Souvarine, who unlike Pivert, is seen as both strong enough to keep the radical factions in line and capable of leading the Commune to its final glory!"

comfrance.18.d:0 "During the inauguration ceremony of the new Comité de Salut Public at the Bourse Générale du Travail, BGT Chairman Sébastien Faure claimed that the triumph of Anarchiste values was also his, and thus refused to step down from his position. For Nestor Makhno, to whom Guérin had promised the post, it's a snub, considering it as evidence of French xenophobia. The BGT will have to decide between Makhno the soldier and Faure the thinker."

comfrance.69.d:0 "Those dirty little french rats have recently organized a sabotage with the help of French Syndicalists have revived the Muslim Committee in the International and have invited us to join. The new Committee will be spreading Socialist propaganda in the Muslim World and coordinate assistance to regional left-wing parties. This could be a perfect opportunity to gain credibility in Muslim circles both in Central Asia as well as abroad. The downside of this Committee is the possibility of religious conflict."

comfrance.10300.d:0 "The Chileans have asked for assistance in improving their army in the face of hostile imperialist foes such as Argentina.

Furthermore, they could prove invaluable at safeguarding the revolution in the New World."

comfrance.118.d:0 "The Congress has been received with anxiety in Germany.

According to the document, we would be obliged to aid the Kaiser, should Germany be attacked by the Commune of France, and vice versa. This is an excellent chance to break our international isolation, as well as secure our western flank until our army is rebuilt."

comfrance.122.t:0 "The Kaiser Promises Protection"

comfrance.127.t:0 "The Phalanstère International Research Organisation"
comfrance.127.d:0 "As time has passed it has quickly become apparent that the global revolution requires far more than just devotion to the cause. With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries. And thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère International Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère International' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
comfrance.127.a:0 "Participation sounds good."

comfrance.128.t:0 "The Phalanstère International Industrial Programme"
comfrance.128.d:0 "It has become apparent to many in the Internationale that it is the responsibility of all sufficiently-developed syndicalist nations to provide industrial support to those nations that are less able to provide for themselves. The choice is now upon us to decide whether we should stand in solidarity with workers around the world by helping implement a massive programme of industrial aid alongside our French brothers-in-arms."

comfrance.129.a:0 "Excellent!"

comfrance.130.t:0 "A Jacobin Reformation?"
comfrance.130.d:0 "Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comité de Salut Public is in the position to begin a complete conversion of the governmental system from failing Syndicalism to glorious Leninism. Hardline comrades are demanding that the Syndicalist structures be completely abolished, all replaced by the Parti Communiste Français in a Bolshevik-Leninist state. However despite Chairman Thorez's support for this initiative, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many more moderate party officials are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established Syndicalist structures of the BGT and CSP while gradually reforming the state along 'true' Marxist lines. Whatever the outcome is it shall surely cause more division"
comfrance.130.a:0 "Moderates are just Social-Reactionaries! Let us build a new system!"
comfrance.130.b:0 "Syndicalism shall be reformed, gradually the citizens of France will see the light of Leninism!"

comfrance.131.t:0 "Restructuring of the BGT and CSP"
comfrance.131.d:0 "The Syndicalist structures of post-revolution France are being transformed so as to better comply with true Marxism as laid out by the Parti Communiste Français. The Bourse Générale du Travail has been reformed as the Congrès des Députés du Peuple while the Comité de Salut Public has been replaced by the Conseil des Commissaires du Peuple."
comfrance.131.a:0 "An improvement, no doubt."

comfrance.132.t:0 "Dissolution of the CGT"
comfrance.132.d:0 "Now we turn on the last pillar of Syndicalism in France, the Confederation General du Travail - the dominant Syndicate which long kept us from taking power in the Commune. We can finally break their power, so as to prevent our rival from further resisting our Communist doctrine."

comfrance.133.d:0 "Our recent reforms, while making grand strides in setting France on the true path of Socialism, have upset many in French society.

comfrance.134.t:0 "Léon Blum and the Front Populaire"
comfrance.134.d:0 "Now the leading Travailleur figure, Léon Blum has begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."
comfrance.134.a:0 "Bring them to trial!"
comfrance.134.b:0 "Leninist valours will endure these traitors."

comfrance.135.t:0 "The Paris Trial"
comfrance.135.d:0 "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin, have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."

comfrance.135.b:0 "Call the whole thing off."

comfrance.136.t:0 "Anti-Jacobin Riots"

comfrance.138.t:0 "The Front Populaire Restores Order"
comfrance.138.d:0 "The Front Populaire has seized Paris and have begun purging the Jacobins from the city. Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the Communist Party. Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions, the CGT and BGT, and in emergency elections Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail with Blum appointed Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public. Now that this grand alliance of Syndicalists, Social Democrats and Socialists have seized power, they hope to undo the totalitarian oppression emposed on the French citizens by the Jacobins"

comfrance.141.d:0 "The extremist Jacobin faction has driven the illegitimate Commune to the precipice. The socialists fight among themselves as France burns. The traitor general Maurice Gamelin failed to overthrow the Communists with his first attempt at a march on Paris and was forced to retreat south. Now, we have received word via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognize our government, as he views us as a lesser evil than the deplorable Jacobines.\n\nAlthough considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us."

comfrance.142.t:0 "Gamelin Joins The Nationalists!"
comfrance.142.d:0 "The arch-traitor Gamelin has declared for the Exiles! His soldiers are advancing on Marseille, surely to pave the way for the Nationalist forces that are even now readying to invade our homeland. Although this shows that he has abandoned his erstwhile allies in the Front Populaire, the syndicalists have taken this opportunity to redouble their efforts, launching uprisings across France."

Legion outposts can be found across France and the Sorelian Red Eagle can be found flying high above well armed militants loyal to Valois. \n\nSince the victory of the Sorelians there has been suggestions to merge the Legion with the French Revolutionary Armed Forces, despite resistance from notable generals such as Maurice Gamelin, on this day the Legion will officially be incorporated into thr military under the command of General Marcel Bucard."

comfrance.903.d:0 "The Sorelians emerged during the French Civil War as violent, revolutionary and staunchly anti-reactionary movement when Georges Valois, Hubert Lagardelle and Jacques Arthuys decided that the time was right to turn their underground political group, Cercle Proudhon, into a fully fledged political movement. These three men observed the Weltkrieg as the beginning of a new age, one where capitalism and traditionalism would be replaced by syndicalism and nationalism. Despite being former associates of Action Française the three launched a scathing campaign against social conservatives, monarchists and all who stood against the revolution. \n\nAdopting the red eagle as their symbol the Sorelians have quickly gained popularity amongst the working-class who saw their organised marches, uniformed militia and violent altercations with reactionaries as a form of expressing their outrage to the establishment. When the Civil War ended and the anarcho-syndicalists took the seat of power in Paris the Sorelians changed their rhetoric anti-reactionary to anti-anarchy. \n\n Up until now the Travailleur's have used the Sorelians as a bulwark against reactionaries however now are terrified that these radicals may at long last turn on them in the upcoming elections. Demanding; centralization, revanchism against Germany and a restoration of French nationalism the Sorelians now poses a major threat to the Anarcho-Syndicalist Commune with it’s paramilitary, the Revolutionary Legion, engaging in street fights and the intimidation of political opponents. Will the Sorelians bring France into disarray once more or shall they lead the glorious charge of National-Syndicalism?"

Inspired by both Lenin’s failed Bolshevik Revolution and French revolutionary history they seek to bring an end to Syndicalism, citing it as a failed ideology manipulated by ‘Social-Reactionaries’ to further control the proletariat. Led by revolutionary hero, Maurice Thorez, a man who has now forsaken his former Syndicalist loyalties and pledged allegiance to the international communist revolution. Thorez has stated his conversion to what many perceive as an obsolete ideology, is a direct response to the growing bureaucracy and corruption in CGT. \n\nTaking their name from the violent revolutionary movement under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre, the Jacobins see themselves a vanguard against anarchists and social-reactionaries who are more than willing to use violence to spread the word of Marx. Currently they are engaged in a bitter rivalry with the Sorelians that has escalated into large scale street fights between the Revolutionary Legion and Jacobin militants. However, despite the use of violence and a previously complete rejection of the CGT’s authority, Thorez has announced his intention for the Jacobins to stand in the upcoming elections. It is to be seen how receptive the greater populace are to Thorez’s idealistic communist state, will they embrace the legacy of Lenin or loyally defend Syndicalism?"

The Red Eagle banner was hung from building to building, torches were carried by a parade of gloomy looking legionaries, an atmosphere of depression had engulfed the city.

The resulting blast injured all three men on the stage, the latter two being cabinet member Marcel Déat and Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux, Pierre Laval. All three were immediately driven to the nearest hospital whilst brave legionaries returned fire at the terrorist scum, two were shot dead whilst the last is in captivity. Thankfully camrades Déat and Laval survived the explosion with minor injuries however Valois did not, despite the hospital’s best efforts, the resulting blast and stray bullets where too much for the aging leader. Our dear Chairman was a true revolutionary and his ideals will not be forgotten nor will his death be in vain.\n\nThe difficult task of choosing a successor now falls upon the Sorelian high council, in the meantime a recovering Laval has been instated as the temporary head of government until a successor is chosen.

If we are to move forward with centralizing the government, we need to unite the people under our political beliefs.

The Vanguardists have the most influence over the Sorleian aligned unions and the old guard, members who were involved in the founding of the Sorelians, whilst the Ultranational-Syndicalists have the loyalty of the Revolutionary Legion.

It’s rumoured that the main leader of the Black Guard is famed Ukrainian anarchist who was exiled to France, Nestor Makhno. The Sorelians, after hearing about these rumors, ordered a raid of Makhno’s residence. However, upon the initial raid Makhno was nowhere to be found further fueling these rumors.

Sorelian propaganda has launched scathing attacks and the Revolutionary Legion have begun rounding up Jewish intellectuals, bankers, businessmen and rabbis to be sent to unknown locations.\n\nWhilst Bucard struggles to maintian power of the nation and deals with lingering anarchist terrorism it is undoubtable that this persecutation is purerly done to distract the French people from the nation’s unsure future..."

Unsurprisingly this is what caused the CGT to be brought down by division, however since the Sorelains took power many unions have been cut out of the picture leaving only those loyal to the government. The next step of this plan is to unite all loyal unions under one state sponsored labour organisation. The National Popular Union will include differing areas of professions in order to represent all workers of the nation, it also pledges complete devotion to the Chairman. Finally the labourers can find themselves under the righteous protection of one big union!"

comfrance.935.d:0 "French Society has always suffered under the weak, the frail, the impoverished of corporeality and of mind - for centuries, it was ruled by the weak and frail, it was put under their tyranny of weakness, their tyranny of lack of vitality. It is nescessary then, as a revolutionary Sorelian State, that we seek to estabilish at all costs a French society that is unlike the ones that preceded it in the last 1000 years - one of strength, vitality, and human perfection. The Frenchman must at all costs rival and go beyond the prowess of the German Ape-Man, who is such a brute that they lack even the most basic understanding of the world like we have. The Frenchman, unlike the German counterpart, has always had an underlying sense of vitality and strength, one that was beyond all his neighbors which were either falling asleep in their siestas or being so stupid that they can't change the oil on a lamp. It is nescessary then, to enact an enormous and violent purge of the weak which corrupt French society and have done so for the last thousand years, much like a class war which instead of involving the ruled and the ruler, it instead involves the weak and the strong. Therefore, the Revolutionary Legion has now made tremendous efforts to cleanse our lands of those considered feminine, weak, and frail, and raise up to the sky those who are strong, vital, and in unending militancy against the Ape-German and other reactionaries.\n\nMarc Augier has also begun extremely extensive efforts to create the perfect Frenchman; one that has been dispelled of all elements of Royal frailness, of the uneducation of the masses, that is both intelligent and built like a tank - this search has made us go through hundreds of Frenchmen, to find the perfect specimen. Unfortunately this perfect Frenchman is still being searched for despite hundreds of people volunteering to go through our scientist's hands."

We need, as a State, to protect the youth from reactionary ideals and give them the light of our vanguard, to give them the light of violence, of militancy, of power and unending restlessness. Therefore, Chairman Déat has created the Déat Jeunesse, a paramilitary organization that seeks to train young boys into becoming militant and extremely loyal beacons of the Revolution through rigorous training, education, and camraderie.

He screamed in adoration to the Commune, to the Revolution, proclaiming in profound militancy, that it was time to create a 'Communism with French Characteristics'.\n\nThis new Communism, he says, must do away with the ideals of Faure, Sorel, and other fifth-columnists and realize that France has an incredible and rich history of revolution and revolt. It is undoubtedly a Nation born out of revolution, a Nation that grew out of revolution, and a Nation that lives now in Revolution. It is clear to everyone, that France must follow her own way in Communism, to ensure a future in socialist society where the Commune lives and breathes independently, with profound power that shall eventually wipe the world from reactionary forces and bring about a new age of French Communism."

She shall transfer the Revolution to the whole world, in the ideals of Leninism and Marxism, the correct line of communism.

It is logical, then, to know that there are thousands, if not tens of thousands of books, which are incredibly reactionary in nature and violently against our Sorelian Revolution. Our great Comrade, Marcel Déat, has declared then, that some factories must be directed towards book-making of a specific, single book, engineered to be the most perfect expression of the French Sorelian Revolution; Quotations from Chairman Déat. This book was created by Déat himself, of course, and edited by himself, published by the State, which of course, is an extension of Déat's benevolent and fierce hand against the reactionaries, and printed by state-owned companies. The only remaining part is distribution - which part of the French State is needing to be directed politically to the correct line of syndicalism? Of course, it's the Army! Tens of thousands of copies of the book have been distributed across the army to every single batallion, ensuring that each of them has a commander which will read every little part of this wonderful book for them, to educate them further into the light of Sorel's legacy. Many are already begging for the book to be released to the public, believing that the people want it so badly that they would be willing to fight for it."

The Jacobins and Anarchistes have already been declared enemies of the state due to their destructive beliefs. However there are those within the Travailleurs who could be swayed. Camrade Marcel Déat has proposed the idea of approaching certain Travailleurs who hold influence over the unions, by providing them with minimal powers we could better position ourselves as the legitimate representation of the workers. However, camrade Marcel Bucard has reputed this plan and demanded that all political rivals should be removed from power, stating their previous hostility to the Sorelians.\n\nWhich comrade should we listen to?"

For tens of thousands of years, Humanity sat upon the dark cave of unknowingness, of fear and of ignorance, believing in magical fairytales about gods up in the sky, about gods of the Sun, about gods of the Earth, about gods of the Ocean. No longer - we, as the vanguard of humanity as a whole proclaims in one sole breath that Religion is done away with, it is no longer nescessary, and will never again be a valid form of thought. The reactionary forces that plagued mankind's brain for thousands of years has just been completely removed in the land of the Commune, and our comrade Marcel Cachin has just recently stated that he himself will ensure that the immense effort nescessary to finally wipe religion from even the most private of gatherings, from the most reactionary minds that permeate our lands, to even upper rankings in the Party which for some bizarre reason still hold on to this reactionary concept. No more. We are done with religion for-ever, and we shall ensure that the rest of the world will follow suit. What is next for our Commune? Of course, I understand, and the Party understands that the people need a cult, some form of myth to believe in - so, I have proclaimed the Cult of the Supreme Being, just like the one from the old French Revolution - and in it, a great myth of socialist realism will be put forward, one of reality, one of facts, and one of progressivism. One will believe now, profoundly, in their heart, in the ideals of the Revolution, not in the Church.'\n\nThe crowds of course, fiercely applauded, as comrades across the Commune rose in positive demonstrations to show their support for the PCF's decision."

He had decided, in an order which rang across the world, that Terror was the Order of the Day.\n\nImmediately hundreds of mid and high-level Communard Anarchists, Sorelians, Syndicalists, and others were rushedly taken from their homes, put in a guillotine, and in front of everyone, killed like cattle, one after the other, becoming hunks of meat in the floor, losing every inch of their life, and so just like that, the Commune has slowly been draining itself of political expertise, scientists, members of the political scene, and more, with the strike of a guillotine.\n\nMuch like Robespierre, Thorez himself believed this wasn't enough. More blood had to be spilled for the beloved Commune to be cleansed of corruption. So, he smiled. In a field of sorrow, screams, and agony, he smiled."

His ideals were unparallaled in knowledge and understanding of the correct line of Marxism, and it is with our profound belief that Marxism-Leninism is the future of the Commune. It has been an incredible, unprecedented corruption and rottenness that has taken over the European continent and beyond with Syndicalism, being a force that destroys the creative force of socialism and Lenin's ideals. Therefore, to show that the great legacy of our comrade Lenin did not fall in deaf ears, we shall construct a great statue of the man, made with great care in every aspect about his figure, from his forehead to his shoes. This statue, a grand expression of Socialism in the heart of our beautiful Commune, shall be the expression of creative socialism that the world needs in order to save it from Syndicalist corruption.

It is then, that when a medium-level Anarchist, a bastard son of Makhno, began organizing a "protracted people's war" against the State, it became clear that it was nescessary to wipe him like a bug which sat on the window. As Marion fiercely kept attacking, going to every corner of street he could find which had even the tracest amount of Anarchist activity, and arrest those there without trial, silently removing them from the public eye, he also put curfews up, with an increased level of harshness against all enemies of the State.\n\nEventually, after two weeks of looking for this nameless, meaningless medium-level Anarchist which kept attacking our good orderly policemen and ruining our infrastructure, we found him, hiding in the home of a family in Bordeaux. Of course, we arrested all of them and did away with their records, ensuring they were never found again.

Therefore recent reports have provided us with an excellent excuse to dispose of them...\n\nLoyal camarade, Jean Fontenoy, has provided Bucard with a detailed report on his belief that it was in fact Déat who was responsible for the attacks. The day of the assassination suspicious acitivites were conducted, legionaries were pulled to one side and diverted from their patrols, armed terrorists were allowed to slip through the crowd with little resistance and most shockingly despite the close proximity Déat and Laval were miraculously left with minor injuries.

However, as with all things, a transition had to be put into place as not to put too much strain on the gentle proletariat as the transition was made. Thus, the Nouvelle Politique Économique, or NPE, was introduced as a means of slowly reducing Petit-Bourgeois Syndicalism by disbanding all dangerous and overly-powerful unions that have over 1,000,000 members, while keeping those that genuinely support the Worker."

The Black Guard has violently purged and dissolved the Government, burning down the CGT building and demanding that the people reign supreme. As they violently purged the remaining holdouts, chaos was caused around Paris and in the countryside, Anarchist elements across the country backed by Makhno slowly began consolidating control, as paramilitaries fought with the remaining Black Guard Elements. The provisional Anarchist State collapsed in of itself, resulting in a complete vaccum of power. Riots rise up across France, resulting in pockets of complete lawlessness across the countryside and in extremely small areas the size of a neighborhood in the cities - as Makhno and his gang carefully diffuse the situation, saying that this is a true symbol of veritatious Anarchy; full of vitality, destruction, and explosions of creation and annihilation. Of course, none of this was planned, the chaos only took hold due to wide-scale resistance from former communards and Sorelians. As this happens, reporters around the world are horrified of the developments in France and look around at the situation in hiding, knowing they'd be killed or worse if they were to appear openly. Surrealists like André Breton and Antonin Artaud also openly endorse the chaos, seeing it as an extreme form of surreal theatrical expression in France, with Bréton saying: 'This is the absolute state of existence - this is total surreal automatism, beyond reason and beyond facts.

Subsquently, elements of the Black Guard which controlled Paris brought Makhno to a podium and stated the following:\n\n'Comrades! It has been an excellent day - for the longstanding institution of currency which opressed our dear Anarchy has been wiped out! Banks across our Commune which were for far too long functioning - decades ago at the hands of capitalists, and then at the hands of Sorelians - both reactionaries of course, were destroyed and turned into complete piles of dirt and ash! This fire represents a cleansing, one which the world hasn't seen since the Free Territory, and now we have liberated ourselves completely from every element of statist society. Freedom is at your hands!'\n\nThousands began clapping and cheering, mixed with rioting from other forces, and just after those few minutes of quiet and profound observation and listening, it appears the Anarchy has returned back to it's normal state."

Whilst violence, pillaging and looting from rebels, holdouts and occasionally Black Guard militants still ravage the lands there has been development of a new society. When not firing on Sorelain bastards or themselves, communes trade and barter, a small step for any other society however with the collapse of all defining features of a nation this last remaining aspect of modern humanity continues. The only laws enforced are that of the Black Guard, although officially possessing no power, Nestor Makhno serves as the military defender of the Free Territory.

In response to this military loyalists attempted to garrison themselves in strongholds and resist the Black guard, a fruitless endeavour when their own soldiers turned their rifles towards each other. The engulfing chaos seems to have taken hold over even the most loyal soldiers, when responsibility for actions is removed people will quickly lose their sense of duty and unleash their true natural being.\n\nThe military of France is now composed of Black Guard militants under the command of prominent anarchist figures, with no official officers. These officers are democratically elected and have been provided with the freedom to act as they wish however they remain loyal to Makhno’s orders.

However some, mostly Makhno loyalists, have proposed proclaiming Makhno the symbolic military defender of anarchy, a position that would lack any political authority however would acknowledge a form of hierarchy, even if such a position is only one of military necessity. A stance seen as hypocritical by some. It should be noted that even if we choose to have no leader, Makhno is still a beloved figure amongst the public and the most powerful man in France, his military might and political influence would certainly not disappear..."

Rejecting morality and legality, Illegalists saw crime as a pursuit of one’s own desires and individuality.\n\nWith the totalitarian regime of the Sorelians, this strand of anarchism that is seen as radical even by anarcho-syndicalists has resurfaced amongst workers wishing to rebel against the National Workers State. Notorious anarchist Nestor Makhno, himself has begun to slightly drift towards Illegalism. Witnessing the failures of his anarcho-communist comrades in Ukraine and the failure of anarcho-syndicalists in both the Travailleurs and Anarchistes to prevent the rise of the Sorelains, the ideas of the complete abolition of hierarchy and use of crime has been seen by Makhno as nescessary to free France.

Just be careful not to crash any, for we only have a fragile few, and they are currently very temperamental and very hard to replace."
comfrance.1000.a:0 "Onwards and upwards!"

comfrance.1001.t:0 "Experimental Technologies from the Third Internationale"
comfrance.1001.d:0 "Seeking to put their recent technological breakthroughs to the test, the few Americans friendly to our cause worked feverishly with Internationale aeronautical engineers, helping to create new military hardware to be tested on the frontlines here at the fringes of the revolutionary sphere. The centerpiece inventions of these new shipments are the Sikorsky R-4 and the Platt-LePage XR-1, along with the experimental Type 171 Sycamore of Anglo design. These ‘hoverflies’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters or advanced autogyros by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these helicopters have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers while also being adept at recon and supply. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Anglos sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of our alliance."
comfrance.1001.a:0 "We will ensure these are put to good use."

comfrancegamelin.1.t:0 "Crackdown on the Jacobins"
comfrancegamelin.1.d:0 "After the traitorous PCF regieme and it's leader Maurice Thorez were ousted by General Gamelin and Comrade Blum, there are still many enemies within our country who support the disgusting ideas of a the totalitarian, Leninist system! We must show them that we don't tolerate such dangerous ideas, but how should we do that? Should we take a harsh approach on the remaining Jacobins held in custody, have them persecuted by the police and punished with brute force, or should we show mercy and sentence them to serve their time then attempt to reintegrate them into society?"
comfrancegamelin.1.a:0 "No mercy! Hunt down the traitors and shoot them!"
comfrancegamelin.1.b:0 "Round them up and sentence them to serve time in our prisons!"

comfrancegamelin.2.t:0 "Preparation for the Jacobin Trials"
comfrancegamelin.2.d:0 "Now that the new government has taken the first steps towards stabilization, it is time to call the Jacobin leadership to account for their betrayal of the commune! The Front Populaire, in consultation with the Supreme Court, has issued summonses for all prominent Jacobin politicians to attend a large-scale trial that seeks to determine the punishment for their betrayal. It has already been decided in advance that the leader of the Jacobins, Maurice Thorez, should be given a separate trial to personally decide his fate. It was also decided that the process for the other leaders should start as soon as possible."
comfrancegamelin.2.a:0 "Nobody is above the law!"

comfrancegamelin.3.t:0 "The Trials"
comfrancegamelin.3.d:0 "After a short preparation time, the day of the trial has arrived. There were over a dozen other defendants in the dock, along with well-known politicians and officers such as Jacques Duclos and Marcel Cachin, who were waiting for awaiting their verdict. The process spanned several days, filled with dramatic speeches by the defendants and courageous lectures by prosecutors. After all the defendants had finally been heard, the court withdrew for consultation for a further day after completion of the taking of evidence. The tension was virtually unbearable as the hour came for the verdict. The Supreme Judge began his speech to announce the verdict and it read ..."
comfrancegamelin.3.a:0 "...Hang those found most responsible, the rest shall be sentenced to life imprisonment."
comfrancegamelin.3.b:0 "...Lifelong imprisonment! Keep those traitors in chains forever!"

comfrancegamelin.4.t:0 "The trial of Maurice Thorez"
comfrancegamelin.4.d:0 "A week ago, the other Jacobin leadership were sentenced by the court for their actions and now the head of this corrupt tyrannical clique will face an even worse fate. Maurice Thorez, chairman of the PCF and traitor to the commune, has now been brought to trial. The reading of all charges took more than two hours, and the subsequent trial took more than three days until the court closed the case and withdrew for the verdict. On the following day the verdict was finally announced. The court dismissed a life sentence because of the gravity of offenses and instead imposed the death sentence by firing squad. Throughout the trial,Thorez sat calmly without any emotion and did not say a word, and when he was given the final word after the sentence was pronounced, he said nothing and stared straight ahead. After that, the audience in the hall and the people in front of the courthouse broke out into thunderous jubilation.  Throughout France, citizens celebrated the end of the treacherous dictator. The following day at exactly six o'clock in the morning, the death sentence was carried out in public with Thorez blindfolded and tied to a post, whereupon cheers and applause broke out as the bullets lef the barrels of the firing squad. And so ended the failed Jacobin reign of terror in our nation."
comfrancegamelin.4.a:0 "Mort au traître! Vive la France!"

comfrancegamelin.5.t:0 "Declare Martial law!"
comfrancegamelin.5.d:0 "If we wish to restore order and stability our country, we have to declare martial law and expand the executive powers of the government. The Front Populaire will govern the nation and lead the reformation whilst the military under Maréchal Gamelin will assure the populace remains under control. While this will ensure that we have more room to act and that we can enforce our reforms, this won't be popular within the population which fears that we might become the very thing we swore to destroy..."
comfrancegamelin.5.a:0 "Do it! We have no other choice!"

comfrancegamelin.6.t:0 "Gamelin's Proclamation"
comfrancegamelin.6.d:0 "'My comrades! My friends! Today marks the day every Frenchman breaks the chains that have held him captive to this day! The traitorous machinations of the Jacobins were stopped and the syndicalist-democratic process in our country was restored! The heroes who willingly gave their lives for our freedom will never be forgotten and go down in history as heroes of the Syndicalist Revolution! But the smashing of the PCF alone is not enough to secure our country and the revolution, there is still much work to do! The reform plan that I and my government have prepared contains three core projects that we will implement in the coming years! 1. Strengthening the democratic process in the Commune through far-reaching reform of electoral law, the education system and the implementation of a large-scale anti-corruption campaign! 2. The consolidation of the Communard Spirit which forms the basis of our country, as well as the strengthening of the syndicalist way of life! And finally 3. The reform of the military and police forces to be able to better defend ourselves against internal dangers such as the PCF in the future, as well as against external threats such as our archenemy, the German Empire! Once this plan has been put into action, the commune will rise and shine in new splendor! Vive la révolution! Vive la Fédération des Communes de France!'"
comfrancegamelin.6.a:0 "On to a brighter future! Vive la France!"

comfrancegamelin.7.t:0 "Gamelin Establishes the Milice française"
comfrancegamelin.7.d:0 "Although the military are currently doing their best to restore order there simply is not enough soldiers to patrol the entire nation, therefore Gamelin has decided to establish a volunteer militia. The Milice française, or just simply ‘Milice’, are to be a paramilitary tasked with combating any remaining Jacobin resistance, as well as any potential opposition from other problematic groups. Dressed in blue paramilitary uniforms with a recognisable beret, they are to be armed and trained directly by the armed forces in order to act as a disciplined force. The Greek letter, gamma, has been chosen for its symbolism representing rejuvenation and energy. A fitting logo for a force that will aid Gamelin in re-energising the Commune."
comfrancegamelin.7.a:0 "Fitting indeed."

comfrancegamelin.8.t:0 "Léon Blum Appoints His Cabinet"
comfrancegamelin.8.d:0 "Prior to the Jacobin reign of terror, Léon Blum was not perceived by many as the future leader of the Travailleurs. As Faure’s health declined a battle arose between Léon Jouhaux and Benoît Frachon, Blum on the other hand was a minor figure in this clash for leadership. However the Jacobin’s attempted purge of CGT politicians left many Travailleurs to go into hiding, in a prison cell or dead, it was during this time of turmoil that Blum emerged. Uniting his comrades with the Anarchistes, Sociaux-Démocrates and Gamelin’s syndicalist aligned military he formed a united front to oppose Thorez.\n\nNow as head of government, serving as leader of the Commune under the protection of Maréchal Gamelin, he is tasked with forming a government to maintain the unity of the Front Populaire. Blum has already proven himself a successful man of action and capable of forming relations with political opponents, however without the threat of the Jacobins it will be a difficult task to keep the Front whole."
comfrancegamelin.8.a:0 "Camarade Blum will heal the wounds of the nation!"
