### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
POLITICS_FELIX_GOUIN_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Born as Alfred-Georges Gressent, to a working-class peasant family in 1878, Georges was invested in politics from an early age. Becoming an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel whilst working as his secretary, however he was not always a man of the left. After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny. He has also advocated for vengeance against Germany and the reclamation of lost French territory."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat was born in 1894 to a modest family, in his youth he excelled at his studies and became involved in left-wing politics. A student of Radical politician Émile Chartier he joined the SFIO,  however this political stint came to end when the Weltkrieg broke out. A staunch patriot he enlisted in the French Army and saw active duty, earning the Legion of Honour and five bravery citations. The Weltkrieg shaped his political views, forging a deep hatred for Germany and the French elite who he saw as failing the nation. During the lead up the French Civil War, Déat has positioned himself to the right of the socialist movement, advocating for an authoritarian anti-capitalist state. His work was published by Valois who had taken interest in Déat and the two became fast allies, when the General Strike led to civil conflict Déat declared loyalty to the Sorelans.\n\nRepresenting the ‘Vanguardist’ faction of the Sorelians, Déat has proved himself to be an opportunist first, and ideologue second. Forging connections with former political enemies and taking action against fellow comrades, Déat has fought his way to the top of the Sorelian leadership. Now in control of the National Worker’s State, Chairman Déat can lead the authoritarian anti-capitalist regime he always envisioned."
POLITICS_MARCEL_BUCARD_DESC:0 "Many things Marcel Bucard has been called over the years. Syndicalist, Anti-semite, Nationalist, Worker. Beginning life as the son of a butcher in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Marcel Bucard initially studied to become a Catholic Priest. This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Ultranationalist-Syndicalists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the National Worker’s State, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective. To him, the superior French proletariat have smashed the chains of their masters and can no longer be defeated by any force!"
POLITICS_MAURICE_THOREZ_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was born in Pas-de-Calais, France on the 28th of April, 1900. Becoming a coal miner at the young age of 12. He would go on to join the French Section of the Workers’ International at the age of 19. His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, causing him to become enamored with the ideas of Communism and a very enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The ultimate failure of the Bolsheviks led Thorez to conclude that they had not been pure or strong enough, that they had failed both Lenin, Marx, and Robespierre by their inability to take every measure necessary for the revolution. Thorez would take up arms in the Second French Revolution, declaring himself as a syndicalist to disguise his true communist nature. A charismatic leader, many flocked to him for his bold speeches and devotion to the Revolution. Once the Commune of France had been established, however, he revealed his true colors, declaring the Commune a bourgeois fourth republic, and converting his followers to the ways of communism. Now calling themselves the “Jacobins” after the radicals of Robespierre, Thorez and his followers became an immense thorn in the side of the CGT. Considering himself to be the successor to Robespierre and Lenin, Thorez would be dismissed as a political failure for his inability to win a seat in the CGT. But now with his rule secured by his astounding victory in the 1936 elections, the “political failure” is determined to live up to his predecessors and crush all who stand in his way of creating a true Communist French utopia."
POLITICS_FRENCH_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With Chairman Valois now dead, power has been vested within the Sorelian Council. Valois never named his successor in the event of his death, therefore to avoid further conflict the Comité de Salut Public was formed. Chaired by Peirre Laval, the council lacks unity with it being split between two competing factions. Valois’s secretary, Marcel Déat leads the Vanguardists whilst commander of the Revolutionary Legion, Marcel Bucard, leads the Ultranational-Syndicalists. With the threat of anarchy looming, can the council unify behind a single leader or will it collapse..."
POLITICS_BLACK_GUARD_DESC:0 "Officially the ‘Free Territory of France’ has no leader, upon liberating towns Makhno’s men have announced their intention to leave all governing to the workers themselves. Laws and authority is enforced by fully autonomous communes which are usually commanded by a worker’s council. However despite this supposed unlimited freedom and abolition of all hierarchies, the most powerful man in the nation is undoubtedly Nestor Makhno. His role as the protector of anarchy allows him command large numbers of Black Guard soldiers who station themselves across the Free Territory. When his men require rest and food the citizens of communes oblige, Makhno chooses to not involve himself in the politics of anarchist communes however it would be unwise to challenge any decision he could make..."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "Born into a military family, 20 September 1872, Maurice Gustave Gamelin was always destined for military greatness. Entering into the Saint-Cyr Military Academy he graduated first in his class, going on to serve in Tunisia. Serving as attaché to future Marshal of France, General Joseph Joffre, this position provided Gamelin with a solid knowledge of strategic and tactical warfare. During the Weltkrieg he distinguished himself for helping plan the victory at the Battle of the Marne. Quickly being promoted all the way to Brigadier General however with the German offensive of 1918 pushing further and further into France, Gamelin was recalled to Paris. Leading a desperate defence of the capital he held the lines just long enough for a civilian extraction saving countless lives. After the war he maintained a high ranking position in the military, as civil tension escalated he refused to allow politics to sway his loyalty to France. When the syndicalist revolutionaries were successful, Gamelin offered his services to the government and was made Marshal of the Commune of France. This came to an end when the Jacobin regime was declared.\n\nAs the Jacobin rule of tyranny tore France apart, Gamelin realised that his backseat in politics must end. Forging an alliance Léon Blum, a Popular Front backed by the military, has overthrown Thorez’s dictatorship with Gamelin proclaimed as Maréchal. Many now regard Gamelin as the defender of Communard democracy, and saviour of France."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Born into a poor peasantry family in Ukraine, 26 October 1888, Nestor Ivanovych Makhno was forced to adapt quickly to a harsh life. Extreme poverty led to him finding work for himself, being employed at a local iron foundry he witnessed the rise of revolutionary anti-Tsarist politics. Having experienced the Tsarist Regime’s brutality himself he joined local anarchists and took part in robberies resulting in his imprisonment. When the Weltkrieg broke out he remained a prisoner, sentenced to death by hanging, this came to end with the Russian Revolution. Being freed he left for Ukraine, forming connections with anarchists he established the ‘Black Army’ to fight against both Ukrainian nationalists and the intervening German forces. When Germany secured its dominance of the nation he fled his homeland for France.\n\n Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his popularity and notability in French politics. Forming the ‘Black Guard’ terrorist organization which has now overthrown the Sorelian regime. With the failures of Ukraine and France, Makhno has been further radicalised by the Illegalists. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future. However his efforts to destroy any remnants of authority in the commune with the establishment of the ‘Free Territory of France’ have so far been successful. These successes may be in vain however, for his personal army of anarchists are the only thing that can prevent France’s neighbours from taking advantage of this chaos..."
POLITICS_LOUIS_NIEL_DESC: "Originally a simple, modest café boy, Louis Niel's life story continues to inspire young Syndicalists today. Born in Corsica in 1872 into a modest family from Bastia, Louis was self-taught, taught to read and write on his own, and quickly forged a political conscience by observing the deplorable living conditions of workers in his native Corsica, which he traveled throughout his teenage years.\n\nHe soon left for the mainland, however, to join the local branch of the CGT in Montpellier, where he was noted for his diligence, exemplary intellectual qualities, calm, thoughtful temperament and undeniable administrative, organizational and stewardship skills. Universally liked and respected by all the Socialist, Communist and Revolutionary currents of the left, Louis Niel wrote articles for a variety of newspapers, from the Anarchist 'Les Temps Nouveaux' to the Communist 'l'Humanité'. These qualities enabled him to climb the ranks of the CGT step by step, until he found himself in the position of General Secretary and thus leader of the CGT in 1909. Despite his skills, Louis Niel found himself elected in a climate of Syndicalist tension, notably between the Reformist and Revolutionary currents. Niel tried to reconcile the two as best he could, but found himself up against the charismatic Léon Jouhaux. These conditions led to his resignation, famously declaring 'I never thought I'd fall into an environment so decomposed by political passions or personal quarrels'. He returned to his life as an administrator and organizer in the shadows, and played a key role in coordinating the unions during the Revolution against the Third Republic.\n\nNiel did, however, return to the limelight recently: after the CGT had seen its majority dwindle and feared losing it, it decided to elect Louis Niel, a unifying figure, as President of the Congress of Trade Unions, a role he accepted without complaint, but without enthusiasm either, content to follow the CGT line. The political climate is not the most unstable at the start of 1936, but some people fear that if a major crisis shakes the country, Louis would not be the ideal man to respond..."

FRA_cgt_mandate_desc:0 "Faure's gambit has paid off, as the anarcho-syndicalists have successfully reasserted themselves as the dominant force within both the CGT and the CoF as a whole. Now the movement must coalesce on those issues around the issues it can agree on, while gaining as much support as possible among other factions."
FRA_communal_policing:0 "Communal Policing"
FRA_communal_policing_desc:0 "Over a decade after the Revolution policing remains controversial, with some semi-autonomous communes using communal policing but much of the CoF relying on either military courts or the inheritance of formerly bourgeois departments that now answer to Congress. However, it's time to end the bureaucratic chaos and make the Communal Policing method the norm, decentralizing local police to being answerable to their communities and recognizing only those elected by their communes as having powers, as such the current departments will now be answerable to them or be part of Congressional Body that will be responsible for either assisting local police or enforcing national laws wherever communal policing fails to adhere to the CGB laws."
FRA_expand_factory_unions:0 "Expand Factory Unions"
FRA_expand_factory_unions_desc:0 "The factory unions are the fundamental base of not just the CGT but industrial syndicalism within the CoF, being fundamental in its establishment.

FRA_farm_outreach:0 "Farm Outreach"
FRA_farm_outreach_desc:0 "While we have some presence within rural France, farmers remain more skeptical of the syndicalist mission than industrial workers do, believing we favor urban regions.

FRA_faure_faction:0 "Faure Faction"

FRA_synthesis_anarchism:0 "Synthesis Anarchism"
FRA_synthesis_anarchism_desc:0 "Petty squabbles have long caused anarchists to fight amongst each other but we must help unite them by acknowledging that each has its place in achieving liberation: Anarcho-Syndicalism allows us to organize the revolution, Anarcho-Individualism allows us to enjoy the greatest amonunt of Freedom afterwards and anarcho-communism is our final goal so that poverty and human cruelty may at long last end.

Within the French People is a desire, and history, of fighting for both egalitarianism and fraternity, something our military recruitment must emphasize both to gain soldiers and to appeal to the French people as well as nationalists while undermining National France's claims of being the true representatives of the French People. Likewise, it must be made clear that France is the Vanguard of the Revolution, and its imitators, while allies, must understand that they stand behind us, not vice-versa."
FRA_blanquist_leadership:0 "Blanquist Leadership"
FRA_blanquist_leadership_desc:0 "The foolish Thorez-Wing of the Party would have had us openly debate strategy and policy among the Party Leadership, constantly writing theory for the PCF.

FRA_centralized_banking_desc:0 "Since the Commune has been estabished, weak motions have been made in favor of replacing the former french currency with union-backed labor vouchers. However this goes practically ignored by much of the Commune except for the most hardline syndicalists, with a combination of barter, various labor-notes and money being used to exchange goods. We need to facilitate the transition to a single government-backed currency for most of the Commune, even if the unions choose to continue to print their own vouchers separately to trade amongst each other a single paper currency should be the only universal one as to stabilize the economy."
FRA_militia_controls:0 "Congressional Militias"
FRA_militia_controls_desc:0 "The various red militias are well-intentioned and even useful at times, but each have their own internal codes of conduct depending on which faction they answer to and their loyalty to the Army is questionable.

FRA_universal_administration:0 "Universal Administration"
FRA_universal_administration_desc:0 "A universal administration must be streamlined and expanded to make Congressional coordination with the unions simpler and allow for a way for all citizens to connect with the government without going through the unions.

FRA_neosocialist_victory:0 "Neo-Socialist Victory"
FRA_neosocialist_victory_desc:0 "Deat has won the power struggle for the Cartel of the Left using his rare ability to draw from both Sorelian, Jacobin and moderate circles all at once, as such he will have to continue to reach out to these politicians in Congress while strengthening his position within the SFIO by shifting appointees within both the party and CGT around as needed."
FRA_anti_capitalist_bloc:0 "Anti-Capitalist Bloc"
FRA_anti_capitalist_bloc_desc:0 "While our coalition is large, it could be a good deal larger. We will focus on creating an anti-colonial bloc, appealing to remaining socialists whom do not support our coalition. As such we will propose formally forming an anti-capitalist bloc with our existing supporters across the aisle whilst also appealing to syndicalists and the SFIO."
FRA_national_class_solidarity:0 "National-Class Solidarity"
FRA_national_class_solidarity_desc:0 "While is may upset the ultra-left radicals, there is a good deal of unity to be found in the nation.

FRA_state_reconstitution:0 "State Reconstitution"
FRA_state_reconstitution_desc:0 "The anti-statist attitude taken by the anarchists had done a great deal of damage to our nation and only by building off of our slowly re-emerging bureaucracy and further empowering Deat can we hope to achieve stability. These bureaucracies will answer not to the unions exclusively but to the state itself which needs a greater degree of independence from them."

FRA_national_peoples_militia_desc:0 "The Cartel of the Left managed to reign in the worst excesses of the maddening localist militias but we must go a step further.

FRA_heroic_time:0 "Heroic Times, Heroic Youth"
FRA_heroic_time_desc:0 "The youth of the Commune are its future and yet many are confused to their importance.

FRA_party_mass_mandate:0 "Party Mass Mandate"
FRA_party_mass_mandate_desc:0 "The SFIO has has been further united under Deat's view and expanded to encompass more of the nation but we must go further. The SFIO will be renamed to the French Popular Party with those who desire government contracts being expected to register at once, whilst the original SFIO label will be merged with the CGT as our union-wing. The FPP will further organize itself to allow for internal democracy, while establishing absolute dominance over the Communal system."

This horizontal integration of industries will greater expand economic efficiency."
FRA_union_mobilization:0 "Union Mobilization"
FRA_union_mobilization_desc:0 "We must both cement the loyalty of the working class to Neo-Socialism and expand our loyal trade unions.

FRA_attack_anarchist_chaos_desc:0 "The anarchists are under the impression that the so-called Right Cartel and even moseso the Neo-Socialists are subverting the revolution when in fact we are saving it from the very disaster it steered us into. They carry on subversion through either protests, organized terrorism, propaganda and seeking our overthrow from foreign sympathizers.

FRA_strike_false_jacobinism_desc:0 "Thorez's communists cling to the title of Jacobinism when the mantle should be ours.

FRA_syndicalist_propaganda_center_desc:0 "Neo-Socialism has managed to take control of the SFIO through the careful machinations of Deat and the failure of the former leaders of the Commune but much of the population remains ambigious about Neo-Socialism. With the creation of a Syndicalist Propaganda Center we can expand our working and middle class support while giving out jobs to loyalistsn and countering lies pertaining to us."

FRA_european_peoples_republicanism_desc:0 "With the fall of his foreign enemies, Deat can finally accomplish his dream of a unified socialist Europe together in peace, stability and prosperity by working with local allies and collaborationists to create a European Workers International.

FRA_nietzschean_vanguard_desc:0 "Our cultural vanguard must have the strength to do what others will not, and as such we must produce the most ferocious attacks on modern society in order to whip the mobs into an appropriate frenzy while pressing the remaining militia members who rely on their support to back Bataille's hold on the Communem, thus cementing his position."

FRA_amenagement:0 "Aménagement du Territoire"
FRA_amenagement_desc:0 "Our territory is vast and inequally developed, some rural regions having been left behind while others prosper and grow at spectacular rates. We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
FRA_hydroelectricity:0 "Hydroelectricity"
FRA_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our mountainous regions in the Alpes and the Massif Central have plenty of high flow rivers, a perfect environment to install a clean and lasting source of energy and revitalise the backwards, rural mountainous regions of the Commune."
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity:0 "Swiss Hydroelectricity"
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our recent conquest of Romandie has opened up several perfect spots for hydroelectricity as an extension of our existing network in the Alpes. Our leading engineers are certain that expanding our dams in the region would be greatly beneficial to our economy."
FRA_chemins_de_fer:0 "Office des Chemins de Fer"
FRA_chemins_de_fer_desc:0 "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became. The Congress agreed on the need to create a new office specifically tasked with the development and maintenance of our railways to connect all the parts of France together."
FRA_mining_expansion:0 "Mining Expansion"
FRA_mining_expansion_desc:0 "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
FRA_plan_prost:0 "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_desc:0 "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
FRA_autoroutes:0 "The Autoroutes"
FRA_autoroutes_desc:0 "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

FRA_eco_direction:0 "Direction of the Economy"
FRA_eco_direction_desc:0 "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
FRA_orth_syndicalism:0 "Orthodox Syndicalism"
FRA_orth_syndicalism_desc:0 "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
FRA_reduce_unemploy:0 "Reducing Unemployment"
FRA_reduce_unemploy_desc:0 "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
FRA_work_design_coop:0 "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
FRA_work_design_coop_desc:0 "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
FRA_improve_manage:0 "Improve Management of Unions"
FRA_improve_manage_desc:0 "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
FRA_dedication:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_desc:0 "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
FRA_fac_towns:0 "Factory Towns"

FRA_Industrialisation:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_Industrialisation_desc:0 "Jean Jérôme is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
FRA_inter_coop:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_desc:0 "While our technical expertise is one of the best in the world, it is too easy to ignore any breakthroughs that are made in friendly countries on a false pretence of superiority.

FRA_war_eco_agri:0 "War Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_desc:0 "Jacques Doriot is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
FRA_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
FRA_war_industry:0 "A War Industry"
FRA_war_industry_desc:0 "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
FRA_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
FRA_cooperatives:0 "Cooperatives"
FRA_cooperatives_desc:0 "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchiste, he is a proponent of Cooperatives. The Commune's government is primarily here to serve its workers, and it must ensure the best working conditions for them. Letting them manage their own companies is a good way to start."
FRA_decentralized_industry:0 "Decentralised Industry"
FRA_decentralized_industry_desc:0 "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
FRA_market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_desc:0 "The cooperatives we created must insert themselves in a new, equal socialist market. This market will make the economy more dynamic and allow everyone to pursue their own goals and share their industrial wealth in the respect of the ideals of socialism, without the predatory behaviours of the capitalist market economy."
FRA_ruralism:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_desc:0 "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

FRA_communal_army:0 "The Communal Army"
FRA_communal_army_desc:0 "The French nation has an army, but it is an army that still does not have a unifying direction. Some still propose the same army of the Weltkrieg with High Command. Others want more initiative to NCOs. Others still desire a motorised and mobile army. Finally, there is also the idea of mass conscription. Once we dissolve the military trade unions, we must follow with an unified vision."
FRA_principe_concentration:0 "Principe de Concentration"
FRA_principe_concentration_desc:0 "As the butcher of the Weltkieg showed, there is nothing to be won with evenly spreading our troops across the entire front, taking only metres that we lose the next day to artillery barrages. By making local breakthroughs and investing into them, we can literally shatter the entire enemy front with a few good battles."
FRA_tank_research:0 "Tank Research Grants"
FRA_tank_research_desc:0 "Tanks are not new to us, nor to the world, but they are still a relatively new component of warfare. Improvements have been brisk in tank construction during the interwar, and it seems the true potential of armour is starting to reveal itself. Let us invest generously into the future of warfare."
FRA_fast_army:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_desc:0 "Motorisation is more than the future of cavalry. While the average truck will not last long under enemy fire, it allows us to get our troops to the very frontlines in incredible times. We must make speed the goal of all our tactics, all our training, all our equipment. Celerity is opportunity."
FRA_tank_assembly_line:0 "Tank Assembly Lines"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. By creating baseline quality standards, we can speed up production of armour and supply our tanks with large armoured divisions that will come down on the enemy like a brick."
FRA_tank_quality_line:0 "Quality Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. Regardless, if we prioritise quality, we ensure that our tanks are the best of the best. Thus, every tank we produce will easily crush the tin cans that our enemy desperately output to counter us."
FRA_centralized_hc:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_desc:0 "We are aware that the unsavoury events of 1919 have put a deep mistrust of military High Command in the people of the Commune. Regardless, we will need to rehabilitate the concept of the High Command. The idea of the squad leader deciding combat tactics is glamorous, but who will care for logistics and strategic manoeuvres?"
FRA_analysing_wki:0 "Analysing the Weltkrieg"
FRA_analysing_wki_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, a tragedy to us and our British comrades, is a painful topic to study, but it is one we must study regardless. From the successes and failures of this war, we will learn how the next must be fought. Those who think that new tactics and strategies will sprout out of nowhere as the conflict draws near are deluded."
FRA_war_experience:0 "War Experience"
FRA_war_experience_desc:0 "The French army has fought many wars, and will fight many more. Every time we must stop and reflect on these conflicts, and make an analysis as thorough as possible to find where our plans have went right or wrong. Just because they did not fight under the Commune's flag does not mean they died in vain."
FRA_military_academy:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_desc:0 "War is a complex topic, one that must be studied to be fully understood. While we have found many talents during the 1919 Civil War, we must take the preliminary steps to train new officers. We can also study our whole doctrine and renew the training of our officer corps this way."
FRA_officers_initiative:0 "Officer's Initiative"
FRA_officers_initiative_desc:0 "How often during the Weltkrieg have breakthroughs been made but not exploited due to unresponsive officers? We must ensure this does not happen again, every regiment should be able to act independently, drawing up plans and acting on them as they see fit. This is the reality of modern warfare, Napoleonic columns are history."
FRA_mission_type:0 "Mission Type Tactics"
FRA_mission_type_desc:0 "Our plans are not meant to be tasklists, else our troops are paralysed once the unexpected happens. Our plans must always be built with one specific goal in mind. This is the only rigid part of the plan, all else is left to squads to figure out. This way, we will always be ready to adapt our plans as the situation on the field develops."
FRA_flexible_support:0 "Flexible Support"
FRA_flexible_support_desc:0 "To ensure the efficiency of our squads, we must ensure they are served by artillery and support regiments in a flexible manner. This means that at any time artillery must be ready to fire on the orders of any squad linked to it, and support companies must be ready to intervene when called for help on the front."
FRA_empower_rifleman:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_desc:0 "Eventually, we can draft all the plans in the world and stack as many artillery guns in the backline as we see fit, but the humble Rifleman is the one who will win the war. By ensuring that even them can independently take initiative, we subtly improve the efficiency of every squad and defeat those enemies who use terror to lead them."
FRA_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed without a doubt that modern wars now take absolutely insane scales, drafting millions to fight on every side. Every Frenchman must know that one day, he may be called to defend his beloved country against the Reactionaries. We will only be defeated when the last of us perish!"
FRA_improve_manufactures:0 "Improve the Manufactures"
FRA_improve_manufactures_desc:0 "War truly has taken a massive scale, and such a modern war will need an amount of equipment that we perhaps cannot even fathom yet. To the rifle and grenade is added the tank and plane, soon perhaps more. We must ensure our military industry is the best it can possibly be, we will never have one too many rifles!"
FRA_global_organization:0 "Global Organisation"
FRA_global_organization_desc:0 "A grand army needs a grand command. However, it is not the High Command of old, sitting in a war room in Paris, drawing arrows on a map. It is the officers of every squad, of every regiment, of every army and of every front. All together, they will lead our army, and ensure our eventual victory in such a large conflict."
FRA_mass_fire_support:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_desc:0 "With such a big army comes a new idea for the old concept of support fire. For long it was thought that artillery alone could support a push, but we believe that it is the duty of every squad that is not attacking to provide covering fires for those who push forward. This way, our enemies will forever duck as we move forwards."
FRA_grand_army_reform:0 "Grand Army Reform"
FRA_grand_army_reform_desc:0 "Our army is now united in purpose and in doctrine. No more does anyone dare call them a militia or street rabble. This brings back to the imagery of the Grande Armée, and indeed it is a legacy we are proud of. Let us ensure our whole army organisation is geared towards handling this many soldiers and officers."

FRA_equipment_modern:0 "Modern Equipment"
FRA_equipment_modern_desc:0 "The tools of war are ever improving, more efficient, more deadly. To some, this is a tragedy, but it is clear that we cannot shun them. War is an ugly reality, and we must face it. By ensuring our equipment is always the best, we make conflicts deadlier, perhaps. But our enemies will not spare us the courtesy of using those weapons on us."
FRA_special_forces:0 "Alpine Forces"
FRA_special_forces_desc:0 "Mountains have always been a radically different environment to fight in, and most of our borders cross mountains. We must ensure that our training of mountain forces is spotless, and that every new piece of equipment we invent is adapted to mountain warfare. Mountain artillery exists, perhaps mountain tanks soon will?"
FRA_tank_division:0 "Tank Divisions"
FRA_tank_division_desc:0 "It has been obvious for a while, but tanks are here to stay. Their armour is impenetrable to small arms fire, and their mighty cannon destroys whatever it is aimed at. As years go own, their designs become heavier and more destructive. We must stay on the forefront of tank technology, so that we may dominate the battlefield."
FRA_road_to_war:0 "The Road to War"
FRA_road_to_war_desc:0 "The war with Germany is clearly inevitable, this nation holds hostage our brothers in Alsace and Lorraine, and with its many puppets in the Reichspakt it stands as the main counter-revolutionary power in Europe, if not the world, tyrant over hundreds of millions of people. This will stop, we will avenge them all. The first Weltkrieg was not the last."
FRA_renseignements_generaux:0 "The Renseignements Généraux"
FRA_renseignements_generaux_desc:0 "It has become clearly obvious that we cannot defend our country in a satisfactory manner without a modern, centralised intelligence agency. The taboos of old still hold against such centralised, unscrutinised authority, but it is a sacrifice we have to make. German spies laugh softly at our pitiful 'intelligence committees'."
FRA_military_buildup:0 "Military Build-up"
FRA_military_buildup_desc:0 "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently. This may damage our short term economic growth, and this may not be popular for those in our populace who hope for peace and prosperity, but we sadly know better. The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"
FRA_military_buildup_two:0 "Calibrating the Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_desc:0 "The capitalist world is still struggling with last year's shattering economic crisis whilst the righteousness of our own system continues to prove itself. It has been suggested that we utilise this industrial advantage to transform certain aspects of the economy exclusively towards military purposes."
FRA_socialist_education:0 "Socialist Education"
FRA_socialist_education_desc:0 "The education of the French Republic was in many ways excellent, allowing the average citizen to obtain a large knowledge in the sciences and arts. We seek to continue working on this legacy by ensuring that French schools always have learning and education as their primary goal, not hierarchy and discipline like in some reactionary countries."
FRA_Our_time_has_come:0 "Revanchist Propaganda"
FRA_Our_time_has_come_desc:0 "Our desire of revenge against Germany has been long coming. 1871 saw us lose Alsace-Lorraine, and the Republican schools rightfully taught their children that it was a French region soon to be seized back. Sadly, 1919 saw our defeat and the loss of Nancy. But we are not done, our rightful anger shall only end when France is whole again!"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals:0 "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc:0 "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population. While ominous sounding, we must create an institution ready to help us remind to our people the value of the Revolution and prevent reactionary influences from implanting themselves."
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute:0 "Blanqui Research Institute"
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute_desc:0 "While some nations resist the teachings of science, France endorses them without nuance. Let's support the establishment of a new research institute aimed at furthering our technological superiority. Where reactionaries doubt every discovery and stand wary of change, we embrace them and become stronger every year!"
FRA_military_buildup_three:0 "Further Military Development"
FRA_military_buildup_three_desc:0 "Our economy is now well developed and the Commune is ready for war, but we can always do better. By encouraging further industrial projects, the Commune shall not only be ready for war but will indisputably be superior in every way to any of our enemies. We will prove to the world that the Commune will not be defeated!"
FRA_military_science:0 "Military Science"
FRA_military_science_desc:0 "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far.

comfrance.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended the way it began: defeated by German arms and facing communist revolution at home. In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. 'The Party of Order' was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in subsequent months the French Establishment was forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, the self-styled 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936, the consensus that was reached in order to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is being deemed as increasingly outdated by many critics, and there are growing calls for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in her security and in her mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is disparate, and it is unclear precisely which ideological strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries. And thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère International Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère International' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
comfrance.127.a:0 "Participation sounds good."

comfrance.130.d:0 "Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comité de Salut Public is in the position to begin a complete conversion of the governmental system from failing Syndicalism to glorious Leninism. Hardline comrades are demanding that the Syndicalist structures be completely abolished, all replaced by the Parti Communiste Français in a Bolshevik-Leninist state. However despite Chairman Thorez's support for this initiative, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many more moderate party officials are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established Syndicalist structures of the BGT and CSP while gradually reforming the state along 'true' Marxist lines. Whatever the outcome is it shall surely cause more division"
comfrance.130.a:0 "Moderates are just Social-Reactionaries! Let us build a new system!"

comfrance.134.t:0 "Léon Blum and the Front Populaire"
comfrance.134.d:0 "Now the leading Travailleur figure, Léon Blum has begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."
comfrance.134.a:0 "Bring them to trial!"
comfrance.134.b:0 "Leninist valours will endure these traitors."

comfrance.135.t:0 "The Paris Trial"
comfrance.135.d:0 "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin, have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."

comfrance.138.t:0 "The Front Populaire Restores Order"
comfrance.138.d:0 "The Front Populaire has seized Paris and have begun purging the Jacobins from the city. Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the Communist Party. Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions, the CGT and BGT, and in emergency elections Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail with Blum appointed Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public. Now that this grand alliance of Syndicalists, Social Democrats and Socialists have seized power, they hope to undo the totalitarian oppression emposed on the French citizens by the Jacobins"

comfrance.141.d:0 "The extremist Jacobin faction has driven the illegitimate Commune to the precipice. The socialists fight among themselves as France burns. The traitor general Maurice Gamelin failed to overthrow the Communists with his first attempt at a march on Paris and was forced to retreat south. Now, we have received word via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognize our government, as he views us as a lesser evil than the deplorable Jacobines.\n\nAlthough considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us."
comfrance.141.a:0 "This is our moment! To France!"
comfrance.141.b:0 "He is a traitor. He will die a traitor."

comfrance.142.t:0 "Gamelin Joins The Nationalists!"
comfrance.142.d:0 "The arch-traitor Gamelin has declared for the Exiles! His soldiers are advancing on Marseille, surely to pave the way for the Nationalist forces that are even now readying to invade our homeland. Although this shows that he has abandoned his erstwhile allies in the Front Populaire, the syndicalists have taken this opportunity to redouble their efforts, launching uprisings across France."

Legion outposts can be found across France and the Sorelian Red Eagle can be found flying high above well armed militants loyal to Valois. \n\nSince the victory of the Sorelians there has been suggestions to merge the Legion with the French Revolutionary Armed Forces, despite resistance from notable generals such as Maurice Gamelin, on this day the Legion will officially be incorporated into thr military under the command of General Marcel Bucard."

comfrance.903.t:0 "Rise of the Sorelians"
comfrance.903.d:0 "The Sorelians emerged during the French Civil War as violent, revolutionary and staunchly anti-reactionary movement when Georges Valois, Hubert Lagardelle and Jacques Arthuys decided that the time was right to turn their underground political group, Cercle Proudhon, into a fully fledged political movement. These three men observed the Weltkrieg as the beginning of a new age, one where capitalism and traditionalism would be replaced by syndicalism and nationalism. Despite being former associates of Action Française the three launched a scathing campaign against social conservatives, monarchists and all who stood against the revolution. \n\nAdopting the red eagle as their symbol the Sorelians have quickly gained popularity amongst the working-class who saw their organised marches, uniformed militia and violent altercations with reactionaries as a form of expressing their outrage to the establishment. When the Civil War ended and the anarcho-syndicalists took the seat of power in Paris the Sorelians changed their rhetoric anti-reactionary to anti-anarchy. \n\n Up until now the Travailleur's have used the Sorelians as a bulwark against reactionaries however now are terrified that these radicals may at long last turn on them in the upcoming elections. Demanding; centralization, revanchism against Germany and a restoration of French nationalism the Sorelians now poses a major threat to the Anarcho-Syndicalist Commune with it’s paramilitary, the Revolutionary Legion, engaging in street fights and the intimidation of political opponents. Will the Sorelians bring France into disarray once more or shall they lead the glorious charge of National-Syndicalism?"

comfrance.930.t:0 "Return of the Jacobins"
comfrance.930.d:0 "Clenching the red flag of socialism in one hand and a copy of the Communist Manifesto in the other, the Jacobins have taken Commune politics by storm through their undying dedication to Marxism. Inspired by both Lenin’s failed Bolshevik Revolution and French revolutionary history they seek to bring an end to Syndicalism, citing it as a failed ideology manipulated by ‘Social-Reactionaries’ to further control the proletariat. Led by revolutionary hero, Maurice Thorez, a man who has now forsaken his former Syndicalist loyalties and pledged allegiance to the international communist revolution. Thorez has stated his conversion to what many perceive as an obsolete ideology, is a direct response to the growing bureaucracy and corruption in CGT. \n\nTaking their name from the violent revolutionary movement under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre, the Jacobins see themselves a vanguard against anarchists and social-reactionaries who are more than willing to use violence to spread the word of Marx. Currently they are engaged in a bitter rivalry with the Sorelians that has escalated into large scale street fights between the Revolutionary Legion and Jacobin militants. However, despite the use of violence and a previously complete rejection of the CGT’s authority, Thorez has announced his intention for the Jacobins to stand in the upcoming elections. It is to be seen how receptive the greater populace are to Thorez’s idealistic communist state, will they embrace the legacy of Lenin or loyally defend Syndicalism?"

comfrance.931.d:0 "The nation weeps the loss of Chairman Georges Valois. Despite the obvious threat that holding a public funeral ceremony creates it was agreed by the Sorelian Council that they must not give into fear. Parisian police, a reserve infantry division and members of the Revolutionary Legion flooded the streets whilst the citizens of Paris flocked to pay their respects. The Red Eagle banner was hung from building to building, torches were carried by a parade of gloomy looking legionaries, an atmosphere of depression had engulfed the city. Valois’s body was preserved in a glass coffin surrounded by large golden eagles posing ominously. The chairman had only served for a short time however his impact on the Commune will last for an era..."

comfrance.904.d:0 "On this day the entire nation mourns the tragedy of our late Chairman. While Chairman Valois was giving a fiery speech to the enthusiastic public beneath the Arc de Triomphe three anarchist assassins managed to get past security and the crowd; one of them proclaimed Valois as a traitor to the revolution firing his pistol at a bewildered Valois whilst the other two threw homemade explosives at the stage. The resulting blast injured all three men on the stage, the latter two being cabinet member Marcel Déat and Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux, Pierre Laval. All three were immediately driven to the nearest hospital whilst brave legionaries returned fire at the terrorist scum, two were shot dead whilst the last is in captivity. Thankfully camrades Déat and Laval survived the explosion with minor injuries however Valois did not, despite the hospital’s best efforts, the resulting blast and stray bullets where too much for the aging leader. Our dear Chairman was a true revolutionary and his ideals will not be forgotten nor will his death be in vain.\n\nThe difficult task of choosing a successor now falls upon the Sorelian high council, in the meantime a recovering Laval has been instated as the temporary head of government until a successor is chosen.

According official Sorelian reports that ends now, with General Jacques Doriot in control of military affairs, the armed forces can finally receive the modernisation it severely requires.\n\nOnly the most loyal generals will receive promotions directly from Chairman Valois, the differing militias will be organised into a unified standing army and the nation’s increased focus on industry will allow for the highest grade military weapons and gear to be provided to soldiers. These are the promises that Doriot has pledged and in return Valois has granted him unrestricted authority in military affairs, he now reports only to the Chairman himself."

comfrance.908.d:0 "With the election over and the Sorelians securing the majority vote, Chairman Valois sets out to accomplish his first order of business, centralizing the government. For too long the French proletariat have been held back by the bureaucratic binds of the Travailleurs. The Sorelians will not stand for this anymore, we must centralize the leadership and destroy the autonomous liberties granted to communes. Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux, Pierre Laval, has addressed the senate on behalf of Valois asserting the legality of these changes in the name of protecting the revolution."

These ideological differences are unacceptable and stand in the way of true French unity. If we are to move forward with centralizing the government, we need to unite the people under our political beliefs. Revolutionary Legion commander, Marcel Bucard, has launched coordinated raids on important union headquarters with hundreds of union leaders being arrested under the crime of disloyal ideals. Once again the Legion has succeeded in defending the revolution."

comfrance.910.d:0 "After the death of Georges Valois, the Sorelians have split between several factions inside the party. The largest and most influential ones being the Vanguardists led by Marcel Déat, and the Ultranational-Syndicalists led by Marcel Bucard. Both of the factions  have been actively fighting for dominance over the party, and absorbing the smaller factions in an attempt to rival each other. The Vanguardists have the most influence over the Sorleian aligned unions and the old guard, members who were involved in the founding of the Sorelians, whilst the Ultranational-Syndicalists have the loyalty of the Revolutionary Legion. Caught in between the crossfire is the newly inaugurated president of the Sorelian Council, Pierre Laval, who has forged close relations with both factions in an attempt to maintain some sort of stability."

Named the ‘Black Guard’, its purpose is to destabilize France through bombings, assassinations and vandalisim. Inspired partially by the Illegalist movement, which has taken some power within the rebel circles. The Guard have made it clear they will stop at nothing to destroy the National Workers State. It’s rumoured that the main leader of the Black Guard is famed Ukrainian anarchist who was exiled to France, Nestor Makhno. The Sorelians, after hearing about these rumors, ordered a raid of Makhno’s residence. However, upon the initial raid Makhno was nowhere to be found further fueling these rumors. The underground movement has so far proved difficult to deal with due to its secretive nature and seemingly random attacks."

The next step of this plan is to unite all loyal unions under one state sponsored labour organisation.

The Frenchman must at all costs rival and go beyond the prowess of the German Ape-Man, who is such a brute that they lack even the most basic understanding of the world like we have. The Frenchman, unlike the German counterpart, has always had an underlying sense of vitality and strength, one that was beyond all his neighbors which were either falling asleep in their siestas or being so stupid that they can't change the oil on a lamp. It is nescessary then, to enact an enormous and violent purge of the weak which corrupt French society and have done so for the last thousand years, much like a class war which instead of involving the ruled and the ruler, it instead involves the weak and the strong. Therefore, the Revolutionary Legion has now made tremendous efforts to cleanse our lands of those considered feminine, weak, and frail, and raise up to the sky those who are strong, vital, and in unending militancy against the Ape-German and other reactionaries.\n\nMarc Augier has also begun extremely extensive efforts to create the perfect Frenchman; one that has been dispelled of all elements of Royal frailness, of the uneducation of the masses, that is both intelligent and built like a tank - this search has made us go through hundreds of Frenchmen, to find the perfect specimen.

It is logical, then, to know that there are thousands, if not tens of thousands of books, which are incredibly reactionary in nature and violently against our Sorelian Revolution. Our great Comrade, Marcel Déat, has declared then, that some factories must be directed towards book-making of a specific, single book, engineered to be the most perfect expression of the French Sorelian Revolution; Quotations from Chairman Déat. This book was created by Déat himself, of course, and edited by himself, published by the State, which of course, is an extension of Déat's benevolent and fierce hand against the reactionaries, and printed by state-owned companies. The only remaining part is distribution - which part of the French State is needing to be directed politically to the correct line of syndicalism? Of course, it's the Army! Tens of thousands of copies of the book have been distributed across the army to every single batallion, ensuring that each of them has a commander which will read every little part of this wonderful book for them, to educate them further into the light of Sorel's legacy. Many are already begging for the book to be released to the public, believing that the people want it so badly that they would be willing to fight for it."

The Jacobins and Anarchistes have already been declared enemies of the state due to their destructive beliefs. However there are those within the Travailleurs who could be swayed. Camrade Marcel Déat has proposed the idea of approaching certain Travailleurs who hold influence over the unions, by providing them with minimal powers we could better position ourselves as the legitimate representation of the workers. However, camrade Marcel Bucard has reputed this plan and demanded that all political rivals should be removed from power, stating their previous hostility to the Sorelians.\n\nWhich comrade should we listen to?"

For tens of thousands of years, Humanity sat upon the dark cave of unknowingness, of fear and of ignorance, believing in magical fairytales about gods up in the sky, about gods of the Sun, about gods of the Earth, about gods of the Ocean. No longer - we, as the vanguard of humanity as a whole proclaims in one sole breath that Religion is done away with, it is no longer nescessary, and will never again be a valid form of thought. The reactionary forces that plagued mankind's brain for thousands of years has just been completely removed in the land of the Commune, and our comrade Marcel Cachin has just recently stated that he himself will ensure that the immense effort nescessary to finally wipe religion from even the most private of gatherings, from the most reactionary minds that permeate our lands, to even upper rankings in the Party which for some bizarre reason still hold on to this reactionary concept. No more. We are done with religion for-ever, and we shall ensure that the rest of the world will follow suit. What is next for our Commune? Of course, I understand, and the Party understands that the people need a cult, some form of myth to believe in - so, I have proclaimed the Cult of the Supreme Being, just like the one from the old French Revolution - and in it, a great myth of socialist realism will be put forward, one of reality, one of facts, and one of progressivism. One will believe now, profoundly, in their heart, in the ideals of the Revolution, not in the Church.'\n\nThe crowds of course, fiercely applauded, as comrades across the Commune rose in positive demonstrations to show their support for the PCF's decision."

He had decided, in an order which rang across the world, that Terror was the Order of the Day.\n\nImmediately hundreds of mid and high-level Communard Anarchists, Sorelians, Syndicalists, and others were rushedly taken from their homes, put in a guillotine, and in front of everyone, killed like cattle, one after the other, becoming hunks of meat in the floor, losing every inch of their life, and so just like that, the Commune has slowly been draining itself of political expertise, scientists, members of the political scene, and more, with the strike of a guillotine.\n\nMuch like Robespierre, Thorez himself believed this wasn't enough. More blood had to be spilled for the beloved Commune to be cleansed of corruption. So, he smiled. In a field of sorrow, screams, and agony, he smiled."

His ideals were unparallaled in knowledge and understanding of the correct line of Marxism, and it is with our profound belief that Marxism-Leninism is the future of the Commune. It has been an incredible, unprecedented corruption and rottenness that has taken over the European continent and beyond with Syndicalism, being a force that destroys the creative force of socialism and Lenin's ideals. Therefore, to show that the great legacy of our comrade Lenin did not fall in deaf ears, we shall construct a great statue of the man, made with great care in every aspect about his figure, from his forehead to his shoes. This statue, a grand expression of Socialism in the heart of our beautiful Commune, shall be the expression of creative socialism that the world needs in order to save it from Syndicalist corruption. It shall be made in the center of Paris, and through the great labour of our workers, it shall be done in just a few months."

It is then, that when a medium-level Anarchist, a bastard son of Makhno, began organizing a "protracted people's war" against the State, it became clear that it was nescessary to wipe him like a bug which sat on the window. As Marion fiercely kept attacking, going to every corner of street he could find which had even the tracest amount of Anarchist activity, and arrest those there without trial, silently removing them from the public eye, he also put curfews up, with an increased level of harshness against all enemies of the State.\n\nEventually, after two weeks of looking for this nameless, meaningless medium-level Anarchist which kept attacking our good orderly policemen and ruining our infrastructure, we found him, hiding in the home of a family in Bordeaux. Of course, we arrested all of them and did away with their records, ensuring they were never found again.

Whilst they may be Sorelian camarades they are no friends to Chief Bucard. Since losing the power struggle, Marcel Déat has scuttled off with his cowardly clique of sycophants to lick their wounds, we must not underestimate their villainy. Therefore recent reports have provided us with an excellent excuse to dispose of them...\n\nLoyal camarade, Jean Fontenoy, has provided Bucard with a detailed report on his belief that it was in fact Déat who was responsible for the attacks. The day of the assassination suspicious acitivites were conducted, legionaries were pulled to one side and diverted from their patrols, armed terrorists were allowed to slip through the crowd with little resistance and most shockingly despite the close proximity Déat and Laval were miraculously left with minor injuries. Although we have no solid proof, this report is all we need to justify the removal of the Vanguardists."

However, as with all things, a transition had to be put into place as not to put too much strain on the gentle proletariat as the transition was made. Thus, the Nouvelle Politique Économique, or NPE, was introduced as a means of slowly reducing Petit-Bourgeois Syndicalism by disbanding all dangerous and overly-powerful unions that have over 1,000,000 members, while keeping those that genuinely support the Worker."

comfrance.959.d:0 "In a quiet summer evening in Paris, as people sat and drank coffee along with some croissants, it appears chaos has reigned supreme. The Black Guard has violently purged and dissolved the Government, burning down the CGT building and demanding that the people reign supreme. As they violently purged the remaining holdouts, chaos was caused around Paris and in the countryside, Anarchist elements across the country backed by Makhno slowly began consolidating control, as paramilitaries fought with the remaining Black Guard Elements. The provisional Anarchist State collapsed in of itself, resulting in a complete vaccum of power. Riots rise up across France, resulting in pockets of complete lawlessness across the countryside and in extremely small areas the size of a neighborhood in the cities - as Makhno and his gang carefully diffuse the situation, saying that this is a true symbol of veritatious Anarchy; full of vitality, destruction, and explosions of creation and annihilation. Of course, none of this was planned, the chaos only took hold due to wide-scale resistance from former communards and Sorelians. As this happens, reporters around the world are horrified of the developments in France and look around at the situation in hiding, knowing they'd be killed or worse if they were to appear openly. Surrealists like André Breton and Antonin Artaud also openly endorse the chaos, seeing it as an extreme form of surreal theatrical expression in France, with Bréton saying: 'This is the absolute state of existence - this is total surreal automatism, beyond reason and beyond facts. We have liberated ourselves from the State...'"

Subsquently, elements of the Black Guard which controlled Paris brought Makhno to a podium and stated the following:\n\n'Comrades! It has been an excellent day - for the longstanding institution of currency which opressed our dear Anarchy has been wiped out! Banks across our Commune which were for far too long functioning - decades ago at the hands of capitalists, and then at the hands of Sorelians - both reactionaries of course, were destroyed and turned into complete piles of dirt and ash! This fire represents a cleansing, one which the world hasn't seen since the Free Territory, and now we have liberated ourselves completely from every element of statist society. Freedom is at your hands!'\n\nThousands began clapping and cheering, mixed with rioting from other forces, and just after those few minutes of quiet and profound observation and listening, it appears the Anarchy has returned back to it's normal state."

The Black Guard have finally achieved this goal, liberation from the state, liberation from slavery. Upon seizing Paris, the Black Guard denounced their former allies in Britain and Italy, declaring the Free Territory of France the enemy of all nations who enslave their broken populace.

Locked in chains as a symbol of their tools being used against them, the remaining Sorelian militant leaders break as they witness their regime crumble knowing their time has come.\n\nWith these last Sorelian leaders rounded up we must make the decision of how best to execute them, do we go for an efficient method or something more...explosive?

Functioning not as a nation but a collection of fully autonomous communes and soviets united under the protection of the highly decentralised Black Guard. Whilst violence, pillaging and looting from rebels, holdouts and occasionally Black Guard militants still ravage the lands there has been development of a new society. When not firing on Sorelain bastards or themselves, communes trade and barter, a small step for any other society however with the collapse of all defining features of a nation this last remaining aspect of modern humanity continues. The only laws enforced are that of the Black Guard, although officially possessing no power, Nestor Makhno serves as the military defender of the Free Territory. His army is the only thing preventing other nations from taking advantage of the chaos and invading and whilst he rejects any title of leader he has become the national father of this new endeavour.

In response to this military loyalists attempted to garrison themselves in strongholds and resist the Black guard, a fruitless endeavour when their own soldiers turned their rifles towards each other. The engulfing chaos seems to have taken hold over even the most loyal soldiers, when responsibility for actions is removed people will quickly lose their sense of duty and unleash their true natural being.\n\nThe military of France is now composed of Black Guard militants under the command of prominent anarchist figures, with no official officers. These officers are democratically elected and have been provided with the freedom to act as they wish however they remain loyal to Makhno’s orders. When the time is necessary and Makhno must call upon his comrades to defend the workers of France, these warriors will rally behind the black flag!"

We could fully commit to this and announce that officially there is no representative leader for the French people, this decision is supported by the prominent Illegalists within the Black Guard. However some, mostly Makhno loyalists, have proposed proclaiming Makhno the symbolic military defender of anarchy, a position that would lack any political authority however would acknowledge a form of hierarchy, even if such a position is only one of military necessity. A stance seen as hypocritical by some. It should be noted that even if we choose to have no leader, Makhno is still a beloved figure amongst the public and the most powerful man in France, his military might and political influence would certainly not disappear..."

Inspired by both the theories of Max Stirner and militarism of anarchists like Albert Libertad and Ravachol. The movement would engage in criminal activities justified as individual rebellions against the state. Rejecting morality and legality, Illegalists saw crime as a pursuit of one’s own desires and individuality.\n\nWith the totalitarian regime of the Sorelians, this strand of anarchism that is seen as radical even by anarcho-syndicalists has resurfaced amongst workers wishing to rebel against the National Workers State. Notorious anarchist Nestor Makhno, himself has begun to slightly drift towards Illegalism. Witnessing the failures of his anarcho-communist comrades in Ukraine and the failure of anarcho-syndicalists in both the Travailleurs and Anarchistes to prevent the rise of the Sorelains, the ideas of the complete abolition of hierarchy and use of crime has been seen by Makhno as nescessary to free France.

Throughout the trial,Thorez sat calmly without any emotion and did not say a word, and when he was given the final word after the sentence was pronounced, he said nothing and stared straight ahead. After that, the audience in the hall and the people in front of the courthouse broke out into thunderous jubilation.  Throughout France, citizens celebrated the end of the treacherous dictator.
